/**
 * Admin drafts queue (task D, detent-ai-trust-loop-plan.md) -- every corpus asset still
 * `proposed`, waiting on `POST /corpus/drafts/{id}/approve`. The loop's missing terminus:
 * that route is the only function that ever flips `proposed` to `certified`, and until this
 * panel nothing in the UI called it -- every draft this project has certified so far went
 * through the route by hand.
 *
 * **Why this surface and not the other two candidates.** `AssumptionsLog` reads
 * `/corpus/assumptions`, but that route folds in both `proposed` and `certified`
 * clarification-derived terms with no status field at all -- by design, it is a settled
 * history, not a work queue, and it only ever sees clarification-derived `TermAsset`s
 * (`curation_routes.py::_is_clarification_derived`), not every producer of a draft.
 * `AssetBrowser`/`AssetTable` showed `proposed` rows via their provenance filter when this was
 * written, and an approve button dropped onto one of those rows would have had no room to also
 * show why the row exists -- the browser's grid clamps every cell to keep ~4.2k rows scannable,
 * which is backwards for the one row type where more context, not less, is the point. A
 * dedicated queue, mirroring `ConflictsPanel`/`ClarificationsPanel`, is the one place built to
 * show a full question-and-answer per card and put the decision beside it.
 *
 * **Since 2026-08-19 the browser no longer shows them at all, which makes this the only
 * surface.** `serve/session.py::_visible` now withholds uncertified provenance, so
 * `/corpus/assets` -- which reads `session.assets_by_id` -- returns certified assets only, and
 * the browser's provenance dropdown is built from the rows it received (`provenanceOptions`), so
 * the `proposed` option simply stops being offered rather than becoming a filter that matches
 * nothing. No capability moved: this panel reads the corpus off disk and always did.
 *
 * **Reads `GET /corpus/drafts` (fix round), not `/corpus/assets` filtered client-side.** The
 * first version reused `/corpus/assets` -- already declared, already returns
 * `provenance_status` -- but that route reads `session.assets_by_id`, a run constant frozen at
 * session-build time (ADR 0005), so it never observed `POST /corpus/drafts/{id}/approve`'s
 * write within one server process: a hard refresh brought an approved draft back into the
 * queue. `/corpus/drafts` reads the corpus root fresh on every call
 * (`api/drafts_routes.py::corpus_drafts`), the same fix `/corpus/assumptions` and
 * `/corpus/conflicts` already use, and carries `body` -- which `/corpus/assets` does not
 * declare at all -- so this panel can show what a draft actually says, not only its
 * (possibly truncated) `summary`.
 *
 * The approve button is gated on two independent things, matching `ConflictsPanel`'s and
 * `ClarificationsPanel`'s `canCurateCorpus` check plus one more: `tierApprovesDrafts`
 * (`lib/capabilities.ts`). `can_curate_corpus` says this session's corpus_root is writable at
 * all; the tier check says an admin, not just anyone who navigated to `/corpus`, is the one
 * about to certify it -- the only write among these five tabs that changes what the next
 * session's model can retrieve. Neither is the real boundary (`src/governed_bi/api/auth.py` --
 * reaching the port is sufficient); both are the same UI-only safeguard `tierReaches` already
 * is elsewhere in this file.
