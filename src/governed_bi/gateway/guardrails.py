"""Five-layer SQL guardrails (Analyst step 8; Architecture section 6).

Ordered, fail-closed on any layer:

1. **syntax** parses as valid SQL (sqlglot).
2. **policy blacklist** no DDL/DML/PRAGMA/etc.; read-only single statement only;
   no file/network/system function calls (``pg_read_file``/``dblink``/``lo_*`` …).
3. **AST column allowlist** every referenced column is a known, non-excluded,
   non-``suspect`` column (dev/BIRD hard-blocks suspect; prod soft-warns).
4. **term-semantics** referenced assets match the bound terms.
5. **cost** structural cross-join / cartesian-product guard; numeric
   EXPLAIN-based cost (Postgres / Redshift) is future per-dialect work.

These run in the Analyst's ``wrap_tool_call`` middleware. The refuse-gate (D5)
runs *concurrently*, not as a sixth layer.

Fail-closed policy and its cost: several layers include deliberate policy blocks
that refuse rather than risk a leak - L2 rejects anything but a single read-only
statement; L3 blocks star projections and unqualified columns in a mixed
base+derived scope (the allowlist cannot vouch for columns the query never
enumerates or attribute a bare name it cannot resolve); L4/L5 block NATURAL joins
and cross-namespace / db-qualified names. Each trades a false-refusal cost for
zero column leakage. That cost is not meant to be paid by the user: a
feedback-aware generator recovers via the Analyst's repair loop (the block is fed
back as ``RepairFeedback`` and the SQL is regenerated), and the eval's refuse-gate
``false_refusal_rate`` is the counterweight metric that keeps the blocks honest.

Build status: all five layers are enforced. L4 (term-semantics) runs only when
the caller passes ``allowed_tables`` (the Analyst's retrieval scope); with no
scope it is skipped, so a corpus-only unit check still exercises L1 to L3 and L5.

    Analysed per query scope to avoid false positives. Within a scope, the base
    physical tables joined in the FROM/JOINs are graph nodes; an equality
    predicate that links a column of one to a column of another - a JOIN ``ON``
    conjunct or a top-level ``WHERE`` conjunct ``a.x = b.y`` - is an edge. If a
    scope joins two or more base tables that are not all connected into one
    component, the join is an (accidental) cartesian product and is blocked
    fail-closed. A comma join whose linking predicate lives in ``WHERE`` is
    legitimate and passes.

    Derived sources (CTEs / subqueries) are each their own scope; they are never
    required nodes here, but may bridge base tables that join only through them.
    Predicates that cannot be reliably attributed simply add no edge, so the only
    block is the clear case: two or more base tables with no connecting equality.

    This is a deterministic structural guard; numeric EXPLAIN-based cost
    (Postgres / Redshift) is future per-dialect work.

    it. Checking only ``Table`` sources means a nested CTE cannot borrow an
    out-of-scope table's name to slip that table past the gate.
