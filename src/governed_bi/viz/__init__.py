"""Viz: UI-agnostic view models for the read-only audit surface (review side, D6).

``presenter`` turns the corpus and Analyst answers into plain, frozen view models
(corpus health, the table/tier view, the asset listing, the relationship
graph, and an answer's two-axis reliability stamp) with **no UI dependency**. It
reads the full corpus (Facts + Inference + Audit + ``governance.excluded``
assets), unlike the Analyst's ``for_analyst`` view.

These view models are the stable contract the HTTP API (``governed_bi.api``)
serializes as JSON and a separate frontend renders; this repo ships no bundled UI,
so swapping frontends touches only the renderer, never this module.

Editing the corpus and opening PRs is out of scope for these view models: git is
the source of truth (D9), and the write primitives an editor reuses live in
``corpus.schemas`` / ``corpus.serialize`` / ``corpus.validate``. See
``docs/viz.md`` and ``docs/ui-frontend-design.md``.
