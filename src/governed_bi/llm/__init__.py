"""LLM + embedding clients (the model seams).

OpenAI-backed by project decision, but nothing outside this package imports
``openai``: the rest of the system depends only on the :class:`ChatClient` and
:class:`Embedder` protocols, so the provider is swappable. Deterministic
offline implementations (:class:`StaticChatClient`, :class:`HashingEmbedder`)
let the whole pipeline run and be tested without a model, a key, or a network.

See ``governed_bi.config.ModelConfig`` for what these clients are told to use.
