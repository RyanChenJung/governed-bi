"""Serve-time clarification (HITL) — the ``ask_user`` payload contract.

Implements the server side of
``docs/plans/hitl-clarification-contract.md``. The agent asks the user one
question mid-turn via the ``ask_user`` tool, which calls ``interrupt(request)``;
the request surfaces to the ``useStream`` client as ``stream.interrupt.value``.
The client answers with ``stream.respond(response)``; that ``response`` is what
``interrupt`` returns.

These are plain JSON-able dicts (no pydantic) because they cross the LangGraph
interrupt boundary and are re-serialized by the server; the shapes here are the
single source of truth the frontend mirrors (contract §3/§4/§9).

      failing the turn (§4 extension, this round).
