"""Analyst step 10: answer assembly + reliability stamp (D5).

The stamp reports on **two independent axes** (kept explicit so callers never
mistake one for the other):

- ``safety_clearance`` (bool): did a guardrail-passing query, executed as the
  requesting principal, back this answer? This is a *gate* - it is true for every
  assembled answer by construction (nothing reaches assembly until the five
  guardrail layers pass and execution succeeds) and false for every refusal. It
  says nothing about whether the number is right.
- ``semantic_assurance`` (enum): how well-grounded the answer is - ``grounded``
  (clean run, no uncertainty flag), ``heuristic`` (a low-confidence join, suspect
  column in scope, Corrective-RAG, a *repaired* query, or a *deferred*
  clarification fired a flag), ``unverified`` (fenced-raw fallback), or ``none``
  (refused). This is the axis that should drive automatic-delivery decisions and
  cache admission - an answer is never delivered/cached merely because it is
  *safe*.

The two-axis stamp above is the **canonical** reliability vocabulary.
``ReliabilityTier`` is a **display-only** single-axis projection of it, kept only
for a compact UI badge and the fail-closed refusal check, never a second
vocabulary (``governed`` == cleared + ``grounded``, ``lineage`` == cleared +
``heuristic``, ``fenced_raw`` == ``unverified``, ``refused`` == not cleared). The
projection is kept 1:1 with ``semantic_assurance`` so the two never drift.

The thresholds and the signal set are **uncalibrated heuristics** - a first cut to
be tuned against the eval (which boundary catches the wrong answers without
over-refusing), not calibrated probabilities. The mapping here is deterministic
and testable; the agent core (``analyst.agent``) feeds it the signals it
accumulated while running the outer ``StateGraph`` + inner agent loop.
