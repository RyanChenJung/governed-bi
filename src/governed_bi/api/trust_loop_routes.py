"""``GET /threads/{thread_id}/raised`` and ``GET /trust-loop/metrics`` (detent-ai-trust-loop-plan.md,
tasks B-1 and C).

Two read models, one file. C's own count -- "how many became approved rules" -- is computed the
same way B-1 asks "did what this thread raised become a certified asset": reload the corpus,
recompute the expected asset id, read its current provenance. C adds "for everyone, not one
thread" and "and how many of those were later retrieved" on top; nothing about the underlying
mechanics changes, so this stays the one file that owns "read both ledgers plus the corpus plus
the turn log" rather than a second module restating the same reads. See :func:`make_raised_router`
for B-1's own reasoning about why this dependency set earns its own file at all (not
``curation_routes.py``, 984/1000 against ADR 0005 §6's hard cap; not ``feedback_routes.py``, whose
own docstring is about a *record type*, not a cross-ledger read).

**The question this answers, and only this question.** "Given a thread, what did it raise, and
what became of it?" -- read-only, over ledgers that already exist (``feedback.jsonl``,
``clarifications.jsonl``) and the corpus assets those ledgers fold into. No new write path, and
no new engine field: everything this route reports was already durable before task B touched
anything.

**Why "thread" and not "user".** This engine has no identity concept (``api/routes.py::
_identity`` falls back to the thread id when the caller supplies none, and the UI supplies
none) -- see the plan's own note on this. So "the reader who raised something" is, operationally,
the thread that raised it, and this route is keyed on ``thread_id`` rather than any notion of an
account.

**Why a new file, not ``feedback_routes.py``.** This route reads *both* ledgers -- the report
ledger (task H) and the refusal-clarification slice of the clarification ledger (task A) -- plus
the turn log, plus the corpus. Folding it into ``feedback_routes.py`` would misname the concern
the same way reusing ``draft_from_clarification`` for a report's own draft would have misnamed
provenance (see that module's own docstring): H-b's argument that a report is a different record
type from a clarification, so it gets a different module, applies just as much to a route that is
about *neither* record type specifically but about what a thread did across both. Not added to
``curation_routes.py`` either -- that file is 968/1000 lines against ADR 0005 §6's hard cap, with
no margin left for a route this size.

**How a raised item is traced back to a thread.** Neither ledger stores ``thread_id`` directly.
Both store ``turn_id`` -- ``curator/feedback.py::FeedbackRecord.turn_id`` (required, always
present) and ``curator/clarifications.py::ClarificationRecord.turn_id`` (task B-0, optional,
present only on a refusal-clarification filed after B-0 shipped) -- and the turn log
(``api/trace_store.py``) is the one place that already maps a ``turn_id`` to the ``thread_id``
it was served on. So this route reads both ledgers, looks each candidate row's ``turn_id`` up in
the turn log, and keeps only the rows whose turn belongs to the requested thread. A
refusal-clarification with no ``turn_id`` (it predates B-0) is silently excluded -- not a
different failure mode than "raised on a different thread", because this route has no way to
tell the two apart, and reporting a guess would be exactly the "field the engine does not
observe" defect this project's own docstrings (``/corpus/assumptions``, most recently) keep
naming and refusing to commit.

**"Became of it" means "is a certified asset now", nothing softer.** ``certified``, never
``proposed`` -- the plan's own words: a ``proposed`` draft is not yet a rule an admin stands
behind, and telling a reader their report changed something when it has not been approved is the
kind of claim that costs trust rather than building it. Computed by re-deriving the exact asset
id the fold path would have written (see :func:`_expected_asset_id` below) and reading its
*current* ``audit.provenance.status`` fresh off disk (:func:`~governed_bi.api.curation_routes.
_reload_assets`, the same reload every other admin-facing route in this family already uses, for
the same reason: an approval that happened moments ago in this same process must be visible here
without a restart).

**Silence on "dismissed" and "still open", by choice, not by omission.** This route's own
response *does* carry every raised item's ``status`` (open/answered/dismissed for a report;
always ``answered`` for a refusal-clarification, since ``POST /clarifications/from-refusal``
never leaves one open) -- the read model tells the whole truth. What the reader-facing surface
built on top of this (``ui/components/chat/raised-history.tsx``, task B-2) chooses to *render* is
narrower: only the ``certified`` case. A dismissed report carries no reason field explaining why
(``curator/feedback.py::dismiss_report`` takes none), so surfacing a bare "an admin dismissed
this" would read as an unexplained rejection -- worse than the silence H-3's own "an admin will
see this" already left the reader with. And "still open" adds nothing beyond that same
same-turn acknowledgment. Both are real, inspectable states this route reports; neither is a
state B-2 turns into reader-facing copy.

**No fabricated date.** The plan's own minimum phrasing is "an admin defined it on <date>", and
this route does not produce a ``<date>`` for that half of the sentence: `corpus/drafts.py::
approve_draft`` stamps no timestamp anywhere (``Provenance.built_at`` is declared and never
populated -- confirmed by reading, not assumed), so there is no *observed* certification date to
report. ``raised_at`` on a response row is ``FeedbackRecord.reported_at`` (when the reader filed
it) -- the one honest timestamp either ledger carries -- and is ``None`` for a clarification,
which has no timestamp field at all. Inventing either would be the exact defect
``/corpus/assumptions``'s own docstring already refuses for ``answered_at``.

    **``licensed`` cannot do this.** It is govern's table allowlist
    (``serve/nodes/route_retrieve.py``: "Joins are ``pulled_in`` and never enter ``licensed``:
    that field is govern's table allowlist... and a join id in it would be a table key naming no

    table, so it can never appear there: not a data-sparsity gap but a structural one, confirmed
    both by reading ``connect_node``/``resolve_node`` and empirically, by grepping every turn this
    repo's own ``runs/serve/*.jsonl`` holds (zero occurrences of a ``clarification.``/``feedback.``
    id inside any ``licensed`` array, across 221 turns spanning 2026-08-07..2026-08-17). Building
    this counter on ``licensed`` as written would not report a small number; it would report a
    guaranteed, permanent zero -- the exact "comfortable number that is worse than no counter" the
    brief warns against.

    **What is used instead.** ``facet_hits.facet_term.hits[].asset_id`` -- ``register/record.py``
    declares ``facet_hits`` (``Stage.route``) as a real, already-persisted field, and it is the
    term-facet retrieval channel's per-turn ranked candidates, term assets only. This is a
    materially weaker claim than "licensed": a facet-term hit is a retrieval *candidate* for that
    turn's question, not confirmation the fact was rendered into the model's prompt or read by it
    (nothing in the persisted record captures final render selection for a term asset the way
    ``licensed`` does for a table). Reported as ``retrieved`` here because it is the closest
    signal this record actually carries, and every response row using it says so in ``method``
    rather than letting the field name imply more.

    **"Later" is not enforced.** ``corpus/drafts.py::approve_draft`` stamps no certification
    timestamp (``Provenance.built_at`` is declared, never populated -- confirmed by reading, the
    same fact ``make_raised_router``'s own docstring already established for B-1). So this counts
    a candidate hit on *any* scanned turn, before or after the rule was certified, because there
    is no observed timestamp to order the two by.

    Cost, stated rather than hidden: one ``get_turn`` per scanned turn (each a fresh linear scan of
    every log file, per ``get_turn``'s own docstring), because ``facet_hits`` is not in
    ``SUMMARY_FIELDS`` and ``list_turns`` alone cannot see it. ``limit`` bounds the scan and is

    one.

    **The funnel, and why it is one field and not four scattered ones.** ``funnel`` is
    ``[refusals, entrances, approved_rules, retrieved]`` in that order -- the same four numbers
    the plan's own brief asks for, arranged so a reader sees the drop-off without doing the
    arithmetic themselves (40/3/1/0 reads as a stalled loop; 40/38/35/30 does not, and the whole
    point of this task is that the two must not look alike). An entry is ``None``, never a
    fabricated ``0``, wherever the underlying section could not be measured (no ``corpus_root``)
    -- see each helper's own docstring for which counter that is and why.

    **Admin/engineer instrument, gated server-side the same way every sibling curation route
    already is** -- nothing here is reader-facing, and ``ui/lib/capabilities.ts::
    tierShowsTrustLoopMetrics`` is this route's own UI-side gate, named rather than an inline tier
    comparison for the same reason every other tier predicate in that file is.
