"""The graph factory ``langgraph.json`` loads. ADR 0007 §1 and §2.

**Why a factory and not a compiled object.** LangGraph Server can only put **JSON** in
``config.configurable``, and every node here needs live objects: ``policy`` (a
`GovernancePolicy` dataclass, subscripted unguarded in ``guard``), ``agent_model``,
``corpus``, ``index``, ``structure``, ``connector``, ``assets_by_id``. ``serve/state.py``
already records the same constraint for the policy — *"the checkpointer cannot msgpack the
dataclass"*. So the constants cannot ride the wire, and the factory closes over a
:class:`~governed_bi.serve.session.Session` built once at server start.

That is the whole reason the session seam had to exist before the server could: the server is
simply its second caller, after ``python -m governed_bi.serve``.

**Why an ``accept`` node.** The client submits one key — ``{messages: [{type: "human",
content}]}`` — and the record requires fifteen fields. Something must derive the turn, and per
ADR 0007 §2 it must be **server-side**: ``run_id``, ``corpus_content_hash``,
``prompt_set_hash`` and ``knobs_resolved`` are the run's own claims about itself, every
quotability gate reads them, and a client that could set ``corpus_content_hash`` could make
two different corpora report as one — a *forged* comparison rather than a wrong one. Same rule
as ADR 0006's "no tool writes to ``licensed``".

So ``accept`` reads the last human message and calls ``Session.turn``. Anything a client sends
in a provenance field is **ignored, not merged**.

__all__ = ["make_graph", "session_from_environment", "SCHEMA_VAR", "CORPUS_DIR_VAR", "MODEL_VAR"]

#: Which schema to serve. A server serves one corpus; pointing it at another is a restart,
#: which is correct — the corpus content hash is a run constant.
SCHEMA_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_SCHEMA"

#: A curated corpus on disk. Takes precedence over seeding from the live schema, because a
#: curated corpus is the point and a seeded one is the fallback.
CORPUS_DIR_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_CORPUS_DIR"

#: The chat model id. Absent means **no model**, and that is a supported configuration: the
#: graph still runs, retrieval and governance are real, and `/capabilities` reports
#: `has_live_model: false` rather than promising a model that will never answer.
MODEL_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_MODEL"

#: UtkuAI, ported (utku-ai-v2-porting-spec.md): which provider :data:`MODEL_VAR` names a
#: model under. ``"openai"`` (default) or ``"bedrock_converse"``. A separate var rather
#: than inferring from the model id string, the way ``langchain``'s own
#: ``init_chat_model`` guesses when no provider is given — that inference is exactly the
#: kind of "the run's own claim about itself" ``knobs.py``'s docstring warns a config
#: value must never be, since two ids can collide across providers and a guess that
#: changes when a provider adds a new naming scheme would move which model a run used
#: with no line in this file to show it.
MODEL_PROVIDER_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_MODEL_PROVIDER"

#: The model for the turn's small jobs: the guard's scope gate and the five facet query
#: rewriters. Unset means "use :data:`MODEL_VAR`", so a one-model deployment is unchanged.
#:
#: **Named for the role, not the tier.** These are six short calls — one word out of the gate,
#: one line out of each rewriter — and five of them run concurrently on the critical path before
#: any retrieval, so latency there is the whole perceived speed of the product. That is an
#: argument for a fast model, not for a bad one, and ``GOVERNED_BI_WEAK_MODEL`` would have
#: encoded a relative capability claim that stops being true when the models move.
#:
#: It is a **comparability knob** (``llm_utility_model``) and it is recorded even when it falls
#: back, because what these calls produce is *what gets retrieved at all*: a cheaper rewriter that
#: phrases the schema query worse moves routing recall, and routing recall moves everything after
#: it. Two runs that differ only here differ in their answers.
UTILITY_MODEL_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_UTILITY_MODEL"

#: Reasoning effort for the utility model, separately from the agent's. Usually you want this
#: low or unset even when the agent's is high — a yes/no classification does not need a budget,
#: and the point of the split is speed.
UTILITY_MODEL_EFFORT_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_UTILITY_MODEL_EFFORT"

#: The embedding model id, and setting it is what turns the **semantic channel on**.
#:
#: **Absent, every facet reported a failed channel on every turn, and nothing said so until the
#: live stage stream did.** The semantic half of retrieval has been fully built the whole time —
#: `Embedder` port, an OpenAI adapter, `UnifiedIndex.vectors`, `build_index(embedder=...)`,
#: `Session.configurable` adding `query_vector` — and this module simply never passed an embedder.
#: So `_channels_for` marked every facet's declared `semantic` channel `failed`, `facet_degraded`
#: was true for every turn, and the interface called it clean until ADR 0010 made channel states
#: visible. Retrieval was lexical-only in production while the corpus thesis is about meaning.
#:
#: Absent is still a supported configuration rather than a broken one — `DeterministicEmbedder`
#: exists so the model-free path never pays for tokens — but it is now a configuration somebody
#: chose rather than one nobody noticed.
EMBEDDING_MODEL_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_EMBEDDING_MODEL"

#: UtkuAI, ported: which provider :data:`EMBEDDING_MODEL_VAR` names a model under.
#: ``"openai"`` (default) or ``"bedrock"``. Independent of :data:`MODEL_PROVIDER_VAR` —
#: nothing requires the chat model and the embedder to share a provider.
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER"

#: How many times the provider SDK retries **one** call. Applies to every model surface —
#: the agent, the utility model and the embedder — which is what makes it global rather than
#: three settings that drift.
#:
#: **This repository believed it had eight and had two.** `governed_bi.toml` carries
#: `max_retries = 8` under a comment reading *"this repo has NO rate limiter, NO token bucket
#: and NO 429 backoff of its own — the provider SDK's exponential retry is the entire defence,
#: and these two numbers size it"*. v2 deleted the reader for that file, so the defence it sized
#: was never installed: measured on the real objects, `ChatOpenAI.max_retries` is `None` and the
#: underlying `openai` client falls back to its own default of 2.
RETRIES_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_LLM_MAX_RETRIES"

#: Wall clock for one **agent** call, in seconds.
#:
#: Separate from the retry count on purpose: timeout answers "how long may a legitimate call
#: take" and retries answer "how flaky is the provider". They move for different reasons — but
#: they are not decided apart, because the worst case for a single call is
#: ``timeout × (retries + 1)``. The SDK's 600s default at three retries is a **40-minute** hang.
TIMEOUT_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_LLM_TIMEOUT_S"

#: Wall clock for the small calls: the scope gate, the five facet rewriters, and the embedder.
#:
#: **Split from the agent's because the two tiers now run at different efforts.** These are
#: 1.2–1.5s calls and every one of them happens *before anything appears on screen*, so the
#: 600s default meant a single hung call stalled the turn for ten minutes — while each of those
#: call sites already has a graceful degradation written for exactly this case. Failing fast
#: into a path the code already handles beats waiting for a call that is not coming.
UTILITY_TIMEOUT_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_UTILITY_TIMEOUT_S"

#: Reasoning effort, for models that take one. ``register/knobs.py`` has declared
#: ``llm_reasoning_effort`` as ``Role.comparability`` all along, with the reason attached: two
#: v1 ladders differed **only** in this field, it was recorded nowhere, so comparability cleared
#: the pair the second run existed to isolate — and effort moved the baseline arm **+2.5pp
#: against a 2.3pp detection threshold**. So this is not a convenience flag; it is a knob whose
#: absence has already invalidated an experiment once.
MODEL_EFFORT_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_MODEL_EFFORT"

#: Where a seeded corpus is written when no curated one is given. Written rather than held in
#: memory because ``corpus_content_hash`` digests a tree, and because a corpus you cannot read
#: is one nobody can correct.
SEED_DIR_VAR = "GOVERNED_BI_SEED_DIR"

#: Where a curated corpus is dropped in for local serving. ``.gitignore`` excludes it: these
#: trees run to thousands of files (the gold semantic layer is 8035 files / 41 MB) and are the
#: output of a curator run, so git is the source of truth for the authored demo corpus and not
#: for these.

    **Why this exists at all.** The log was written by ``POST /chat``'s ``_logged``, and once
    ADR 0010 turned streaming on, that route stopped serving real traffic — so ``/audit/turns``
    listed only stale REST turns and nothing anyone actually asked. Measured: three streamed
    turns, zero rows. "No turns are listed" and "no turns were served" must not be the same
    observation, which is the exact rule ``_logged``'s ``audit_logged`` field states.

    **Why here and not in ``stamp``.** ``stamp`` is the natural home — sole writer of ``answer``,
    every path funnels through it — but ``tools/check_imports.py`` orders ``serve`` before
    ``api``, and the log lives in ``api/trace_store.py``. Injecting the recorder from the module
    that mounts the graph keeps that order and mirrors ``accept`` at the other end of the graph.

    **Why it swallows.** A turn that answered is not a turn that failed. The client already has
    the answer over the ``values`` stream by the time this runs, so raising here would report an
    error for a turn that succeeded. ``append_turn`` already never raises on ``OSError`` and
    returns the error instead; this catches the rest for the same reason.

    A paused turn never reaches this node — the interrupt suspends inside ``agent_core`` — so the
    "do not log a turn with no record" rule ``_logged`` documents is satisfied by the topology
    rather than by a check. The ``turn_id`` guard stays anyway, because a record without one
    cannot be looked up and would be a row nobody can open.

    """What ``langgraph.json``'s ``graphs.serve`` points at.

    The live constants reach the nodes through :func:`~governed_bi.serve.runtime.trust`, and
    **not** through ``with_config``. They were bound as config defaults, and that was the wrong
    shape twice over.

    It was wrong on ADR 0007 §1's own terms: the section says the constants *cannot ride the
    wire*, and binding a ``GovernancePolicy``, a ``UnifiedIndex`` and a live ``psycopg``
    connector into ``config.configurable`` puts them on the wire's data structure anyway. The
    server then serialises an assistant's config to answer ``/assistants/{id}/schemas`` and
    ``/assistants/{id}/subgraphs``, so both returned **HTTP 500** —
    ``TypeError: Object of type GovernancePolicy is not JSON serializable`` — which is how
    LangGraph Studio failed to open against a server whose own REST routes worked.

    And it was wrong on security: caller config merges **over** bound defaults, which is
    load-bearing for ``thread_id`` and catastrophic for the six keys beside it, since a request
    naming ``policy`` replaced governance for that run. ``trust`` was added to force them back;
    once it exists, the binding it was defending has nothing left to do.

    So the config stays JSON-clean and empty, the nodes read the constants from the shared
    reader, and ``thread_id`` still comes from the caller — the one key that must.

    **One checkpointer, and the nested agent gets it through ``config``.** An earlier version
    of this function built an ``InMemorySaver`` here and passed it to *both* the outer graph
    and the nested ``create_agent``, under a comment reading "two savers is worse than none:
    the interrupt is written to one and looked for in the other". That comment described a
    mechanism that does not exist. A probe: inside a node, ``CONFIG_KEY_CHECKPOINTER`` is the
    **outer** saver; the agent's own saver ends the run with **zero** checkpoints; the outer
    one has three. LangGraph propagates the checkpointer into a graph invoked inside a node and
    namespaces it, so ``ask_user`` has always resumed from the graph's saver.

    So no checkpointer is passed at all, and that is what lets the server supply its own —
    which is what makes ``/threads`` work. ``compile_graph``'s in-memory default exists for the
    CLI and would shadow it.

    **The constants are also declared trusted, and that is a security fix, not tidiness.**
    ``with_config`` binds them as *defaults* and LangGraph merges caller config **over** a
    default — which is precisely why ``thread_id`` is excluded, and precisely what made the six
    keys beside it client-settable. A request to ``/threads/{id}/runs`` carrying
    ``config.configurable.policy`` replaced the ``GovernancePolicy`` for that run; one carrying
    ``assets_by_id`` replaced the corpus every tool licenses against. Reproduced.
    :func:`~governed_bi.serve.runtime.trust` makes the shared config reader force them back
    over anything a request names, which is the same rule ``accept`` applies to the record's
    provenance fields one layer in.
