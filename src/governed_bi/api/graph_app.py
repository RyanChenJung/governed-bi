"""The chat surface as a LangGraph Server graph (LangGraph rework, phase 2).

A thin **chat** graph the LangChain ``useStream`` SDK consumes over the LangGraph
Server protocol. Its persisted state is only ``{messages, answer}`` (both
JSON-serializable), and the whole governed pipeline runs inside a single node,
which calls :func:`governed_bi.analyst.agent.answer_question_agent` (agent-only
serve, ADR 0002) and streams step progress through ``get_stream_writer()``. The
heavy per-turn objects (the
``networkx`` graph, the allowlist, retrieval/context) stay as locals in that
node and never enter a state channel, so nothing here has to be made
checkpoint-serializable (this is why the ADR 0001 "``ServeState`` serializability"
consequence does not apply).

Requires the ``agents`` extra (langgraph + langchain-core). Imported by path from
``langgraph.json`` (``graphs.serve``) and by tests; it is intentionally *not*
re-exported from ``governed_bi.api`` so that ``import governed_bi.api`` stays free
of langgraph for the offline REST profile.

This module deliberately does *not* use ``from __future__ import annotations``:
LangGraph inspects the node's raw parameter annotation to decide whether to
inject the ``RunnableConfig``, and a stringized annotation defeats that.
