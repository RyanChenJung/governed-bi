"""Graph factory ``langgraph.json`` loads (ADR 0007 §1–§2), and the environment adapter.

Two things, and the split is the point. :func:`build_serve_graph` is the **constructor**: hand
it a session and a turn log and it returns the compiled topology the server runs — no globals,
no environment, no credentials. :func:`session_from_environment` and :func:`make_graph` are the
**adapter** the process entry calls, and every ``os.environ`` read is inside it bar one: the
module-level ``LANGSERVE_GRAPHS`` probe at the foot of this file, which asks whether the server
is the importer and warms the session eagerly if so.

Before 2026-08-11 there was only the adapter. The served topology was assembled from a
module-level ``_SESSION`` reached by five modules, so no test could construct it: ``make_graph``
was verified by splitting its own source string and asserting ``"trust("`` appeared in it, and
``accept`` was executed by nothing at all.

The factory closes over a :class:`~governed_bi.serve.session.Session` because LangGraph Server
can only put JSON in ``config.configurable``, so live objects cannot ride the wire. ``accept``
derives the turn server-side; client provenance fields are ignored.

    session that is not this module's, so the rebuild replaced something nobody was reading, and
    reaching for the environment mid-request made a route that had needed no credentials build a
    live connector — under pytest, from the developer's own ``.env``. Bumping a counter is inert:
    the only reader is :func:`session_from_environment`, so a process that never called it never
    rebuilds anything.

    **Why the corpus needs this at all.** ``index``/``structure``/``assets_by_id`` are run
    constants (ADR 0005 §2.8.2.2) built once, so a certified draft used to reach answers only
    after a process restart — a restart neither the reader nor the admin can trigger, which left
    the trust loop's closing move ("an admin approves and the reader's next question works")
    unreachable in the product. Called by the one route that certifies

    ``proposed`` asset, which ``_visible`` withholds either way, so there is nothing for those to
    invalidate.

    **What this deliberately does not cover.** An out-of-band edit to the YAML on disk, which
    nothing declares — still a restart, the limitation ``approve_draft_route`` already documented.
    And nothing is held back for turns in flight: a turn paused on ``ask_user`` resumes inside
    ``agent_core``, after ``assemble`` built its context block, so its retrieval is finished and
    the hash ``accept`` stamped stays the honest one for that whole turn. Approval moves
    ``audit.provenance.status`` and nothing a tool would return for an id the model already knows,
    so a post-resume tool call cannot observe the swap either.

    **Off the eval path by construction.** ``measure/gates.py::_corpus_content_hash_gate`` fails
    an arm whose corpus changed mid-run; the harness (``serve/__main__.py``) builds its own
