        provenance was withheld, approval decided what serves and that sentence became the trust
        loop's closing move — which nothing could reach, because the reload was a restart neither
        the reader nor the admin can trigger.

        **It declares and does not rebuild, deliberately.** The first version called the rebuild
        here: it reached for the environment and opened a live connector from a route whose whole
        job is one file write, and it replaced a module global that an app built by ``make_app``
        does not serve at all. Bumping a counter keeps this route what it was.

        the restart it replaces, not a smaller version of it. Still open: nothing holds the swap
        for a turn already in flight, which is harmless by today's topology rather than guaranteed

        editor surface).

        unknown id.

        **Folds into the corpus (Phase 1c)** via ``curator/clarification.py::
        fold_ledger_answer_into_corpus`` -- the offline entry point into
        ``fold_answered_clarification``, the Enhancer logic factored out of
        ``serve/nodes/mine_corpus.py`` so a live resume and this route reach identical behavior
        (basis gate + ``converted_to_corpus`` idempotency both live on that helper; see its own
        docstring). ``known_assets`` is a fresh ``_reload_assets`` disk read, not the frozen
        ``session.assets_by_id`` -- same reason ``/corpus/conflicts`` reloads rather than trusts it.

        **Setup Wizard composition (Phase 2)**, answering a category-tagged (``elicitation_wizard``)
        candidate: the record's own ``scope`` decides how ``choice_id``/``choice_ids``/``answer`` are
        reduced to text (``curator/elicitation_answers.py::compose_elicitation_answer_text``) rather
        than the generic picked-label/freeform concatenation ``resolve_answer_text`` falls back to for
        every other record -- computed here, against the record as it stood *before* this call, and handed
        to ``answer_clarification`` as the ``answer`` it writes so every downstream reader
        (this row, the ledger view, and the fold below, via ``resolve_answer_text``'s own
        ``category is not None`` bypass) sees the same composed sentence.

        **D join-path auto-follow-up (Phase 2)**: right after an A-category answer names a real
        picked column (``choice_id`` set), ``curator/elicitation.py::maybe_generate_join_followup``
        checks whether it lands on a different table than the question expected and, if so, mints a
        new open D-category record -- appended to the ledger (idempotent by scope) for a later
        ``GET /clarifications`` or ``GET /elicitation/candidates`` to pick up.

        """A reader who was refused submits what they meant (detent-ai-trust-loop-plan.md, task A).

        **The one reader-initiated entrance to this ledger.** Every other write route here is an
        admin acting on a record that already exists; this route is a record's *origin*. It
        exists because ``no_schema_matched`` fires at ``Stage.route``, before ``agent_core`` --
        and therefore before ``ask_user``, an agent tool -- ever runs, so the one moment the
        engine names a semantic-layer gap most precisely is also the one moment it is structurally
        unable to ask about it. The reader who asked the original question is the one filing it
        instead. ``basis`` is hardcoded ``"data_definition"`` rather than accepted from the
        caller: this route is scoped to exactly the shape of gap ``no_schema_matched`` names
        (nothing in the corpus defines a term the reader used), not to ambiguity in general.

        **Decided here: the explanation becomes the record's ``answer`` immediately, rather than
        a freeform pre-fill left on an ``open`` row for an admin to separately confirm.** Both
        reach the identical certification gate either way -- ``corpus/drafts.py::approve_draft``
        is the only function that flips ``proposed`` to ``certified``, and nothing here calls it
        -- so the choice is about the *ledger's* shape, not about who may certify this fact.
        Landing ``open`` with a pre-filled ``answer`` would be a state nothing else on this
        ledger uses (``ClarificationAnswerForm``'s freeform input never reads a starting value),
        so making it visible to an admin would mean changing the shared clarification-queue
        components three other surfaces already render through. Folding immediately through
        :func:`~governed_bi.curator.clarification.fold_ledger_answer_into_corpus` -- the exact
        function every other answer route here already calls, with no branch added for this
        source -- needs none of that: the record is ``answered_by="user"`` the moment it exists,
        the same vocabulary :func:`~governed_bi.curator.clarifications.close_live_clarification`
        already uses for a live turn's *own* asking user, and it surfaces where an admin actually
        reviews unreviewed facts (the drafts queue) rather than swelling the "still owed an
        answer" queue with a row nobody owes an answer to.

        **What "reaches the identical certification gate" does and does not mean, stated plainly
        so the next reader does not have to re-derive it by tracing the session builder.**
        Certification is gated on **both** halves, and since 2026-08-19 they agree.
        ``for_analyst``'s certified-only filter (``corpus/analyst.py``) stands between a
        ``proposed`` term and licensing a *column* in ``check()``, so a reader's own words cannot
        make a column queryable on their say-so alone; ``serve/session.py::_visible`` now drops
        uncertified provenance through the same closure it drops ``governance.excluded`` through,
        so the term this route writes is **not** a retrieval candidate and is **not** rendered
        into the model's context (``serve/nodes/assemble.py`` -> ``serve/context.py::
        render_context``, both reading ``assets_by_id``) until an admin approves it.

        **This paragraph said the opposite until that date, and the opposite was true.**
        ``_visible`` filtered on exclusion alone and read ``audit.provenance`` not at all, so
        every source reaching this fold -- ``curator``/``live_chat``/``elicitation_wizard`` alike
        -- put a draft in front of the model on the very next turn served over this corpus root,
        before any admin had looked at it. The gap was recorded here rather than decided, under
        this initiative's additive-only constraint, and closing it was a separate change with its
        own test (``tests/serve/test_a_proposed_asset_leaves_the_index.py``). Two consequences
        outlived the additive constraint and are worth knowing when reading anything measured
        before the fix: certifying an asset could not change retrieval, because ``IndexEntry``
        carries no provenance and the draft became a candidate when it was *written*; and
        ``enable_clarification_to_draft`` was declared ``Role.operational`` on a justification
        that only became true afterwards.

        Request body: ``{"question": "...", "answer": "...", "turn_id"?: "..."}`` -- ``question``/
        ``answer`` are both required, else 422; ``turn_id`` is optional. ``answer`` matches every
        other clarification route's own wire vocabulary for "the text a person provided", not
        because an admin is answering anything here.

        **``turn_id`` (detent-ai-trust-loop-plan.md, task B-0).** The turn whose refusal this
        explanation answers, forwarded onto :attr:`~governed_bi.curator.clarifications.
        ClarificationRecord.turn_id` unchanged. It is not part of this route's own idempotency key
        (the ``question``/``answer`` digest below, unaffected) -- so a second submission of the
        identical text from a *different* turn is still absorbed as the same record, and its
        ``turn_id`` stays whichever turn raised it first. Nothing here reads it back; it exists so
        task B's read model can later answer "what did this thread raise", the same way
        ``curator/feedback.py::FeedbackRecord.turn_id`` already lets it answer that for a report.
        Omitted, it is simply ``None`` -- the client sends it when it has one
        (``AnswerView.record.turn_id``, on every answer card), so this is additive for a caller
        that predates it, not required for the route to keep working.

        **Idempotent by content, not by turn.** No graph interrupt is involved -- the turn already
        ended at ``Stage.route`` -- so there is no replay to guard against the way
        ``serve/tools.py::_log_live_clarification`` guards a live question's id; only an
        accidental double-submit of the identical text, which
        :func:`~governed_bi.curator.clarifications.append_if_new_scope`'s own scope idempotency
        already exists to absorb. Two different explanations for the same question are two
        different records, deliberately -- a second reader's own words are not a duplicate of the
        first reader's.

        Not gated on ``can_curate_corpus`` or ``can_edit`` -- same reasoning as every sibling
        route in this file: the real gate is ``session.corpus_root is not None`` (409), and a
        capability is a client-side rendering signal, not a server-side permission check.
