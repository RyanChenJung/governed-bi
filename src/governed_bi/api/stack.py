"""Build the serve stack for the API from ``load_settings()``.

One place that assembles everything a request needs — corpus (full + analyst
view), settings, identity, the SQLite path, and the model stack (SQL generator +
embedder + narrator) — driven by project TOML (+ optional local overlay). The
model stack is live (LangChain, needs the ``agents`` extra + a key) when the
configured API key is set, else the deterministic offline default.
