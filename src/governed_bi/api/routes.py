"""The custom REST routes the frontend consumes, mounted by ``langgraph.json``'s ``http.app``.

ADR 0007 §7. `docs/openapi.json` is v1's spec and remains the spec-of-record for the **route
shapes**; it is not the spec for the answer, which changed with the rewrite.

**Every value here is an observation.** `/capabilities` is the UI's first request, so a
hard-coded `true` in it is the stub-path defect one layer out: the interface would promise a
model that will never answer, and the user would read the silence as a bug in their question.
`can_edit` is false because the curator is out of scope. `can_scope` is **true** since ADR
0009 built the routes behind it; `can_search` is still false because `/search` is not built,
and the UI degrades to a client-side index, which works. A capability is flipped by building
the thing it names.

**No route needs a model.** All five ungated routes are projections of the session's assets, so
the corpus is browsable before anyone pays for a token.

    """Serve one turn, blocking. **The degradation path, not the transport.**

    It was the transport while ``can_stream`` was false. Since ADR 0010 the UI mounts
    ``<StreamChat/>`` against the LangGraph runtime and reaches this route only when a streamed
    run errors — so what matters about it now is what it *cannot* carry, and the answer is
    stated here rather than left to be discovered:

    **This route and the streamed one do not share a memory.** ``_GRAPH`` below is compiled with
    its own ``InMemorySaver``; the graph the server streams is compiled by
    ``graph_app.make_graph`` with **no** saver precisely so the server can supply its own, which
    is what makes ``/threads`` work. Two savers in one process means a ``session_id`` names two
    unrelated checkpoints, so a mid-conversation fallback lands on an empty thread: the turn is
    served correctly and in isolation, and the conversation before it is gone. A clarification
    paused on the streamed thread is likewise not answerable here.

    That is a real limitation and it is not fixed by this route, because the fix is one graph and
    one saver — either this route becoming a client of the runtime, or the runtime's saver being
    reachable from here. Both are larger than a fallback deserves, and neither should be
    improvised while turning streaming on. Recorded in ADR 0010's consequences.

    Request: ``{question, session_id, history: [{role, text}]}``.

    Response: **v2's answer, verbatim** — ``{outcome, text, failed_stage, error_type,
    refused_by, record}``. Not projected into v1's `AnswerView`: ADR 0007 §3 forbids
    synthesizing `tier`, `safety_clearance` or `semantic_assurance`, none of which exists in
    this engine, because a reliability badge with nothing behind it is the defect class the
    rewrite removed. ``answer_text`` is added beside them for one reason given below.

    ``session_id`` becomes the ``thread_id`` **on the config**, which is what LangGraph
    checkpoints on, so a conversation genuinely resumes under one checkpoint and an
    ``ask_user`` interrupt can be answered. An earlier version of this route put the thread id
    only in the turn state and asserted the same sentence; it was false, because
    ``compile_graph()`` also built a fresh saver per request. Both halves are fixed.

    ``history`` is **not injected into the conversation** and is not a second memory. The
    thread is the memory. It is read for exactly one thing -- numbering the turn -- and if it
    disagrees with the thread, the thread is right. Accepting it and also replaying it would
    be two sources for one fact, which is the failure this file keeps arguing against.

    Defined ``def`` rather than ``async def`` deliberately. FastAPI runs a sync handler in a
    threadpool, so the synchronous connector and model calls do not occupy the event loop —
    which is the same property `blockbuster` was complaining about, obtained rather than
    suppressed.
