"""Mountable ASGI app for the LangGraph Server custom routes (``langgraph.json``).

The read + edit routes (capabilities, health, schema, ER graph, knowledge graph,
corpus assets, skills, ``/corpus/edit``, and the non-streaming ``/chat``
fallback) as one FastAPI app, so the LangGraph server serves them next to its own
``/threads`` and ``/runs`` and the frontend has a single base URL.

Built at import (a module-level ``app``) because ``langgraph.json`` references it
by path (``http.app: ./src/governed_bi/api/routes.py:app``). Importing this module
therefore assembles the serve stack; that is intended for the server process. The
standalone :func:`governed_bi.api.create_app` factory is still the entry point for
the offline REST profile.
