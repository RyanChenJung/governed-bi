    """``assets`` minus everything :func:`_is_withheld` reaches — exclusion (D6) and provenance.

    ``Governance.excluded`` is documented as removing an asset "from everything the analyst
    sees, in every environment", but only :func:`for_analyst` honoured it. The index was built
    from the full set, so an excluded column still scored in both channels, still spent one of
    the 30 column slots, and still rendered once the reference closure pulled it in from its
    parent table — three ways for an asset nobody may query to crowd out one they need.
    Filtering here makes the index, ``assets_by_id`` and the structure agree; ``for_analyst``
    still receives the **whole** list, because it needs the excluded columns' keys to make
    ``check()`` refuse SQL that names one.

    **Uncertified provenance is withheld here for the same reason, since 2026-08-19.** The
    argument above is about one disposition reaching one view and not the others, and
    ``proposed`` had exactly that shape one axis over: ``for_analyst`` refused to let a draft
    license a column while this function let it into the index and into the context block
    ``serve/context.py`` renders from ``assets_by_id``, so an admin's approval gated
    authorisation and nothing else. Two consequences of that are worth naming, because both
    were measured before they were understood:

    * **Certifying an asset could not change retrieval.** ``IndexEntry`` carries
      id/summary/asset_type/schema_tag and no provenance, so a draft became a retrieval
      candidate when it was *written*, not when it was approved. A refused question that failed
      at routing could not be fixed by approving anything — the open finding that certifying a
      term does not reliably make the original question re-route was this, not a routing
      weight. It is also why the trust loop's fourth counter could not attribute a retrieval to
      the approval that preceded it.
    * **``enable_clarification_to_draft`` was not the ``operational`` knob it is declared to
      be.** Its justification is that two runs with it on/off "answer every question
      identically until a human acts"; with drafts visible, the turn after a draft was written
      already differed. Withholding them here is what makes that declaration true.

    **Dropping an asset is not enough on its own, and the first version of this shipped that
    way.** Removing an asset leaves every reference to it dangling, and a dangling *required*
    reference is a ``fatal`` problem — so ``serve/__main__.py`` refuses to serve and
    ``/routes`` reports ``servable: false``. Measured on the two shapes the corpus actually
    has: excluding one column left its parent table still declaring the id in ``columns``
    (``TableAsset.columns`` holds derived ids), and excluding one table left every join on it
    unbindable. Withholding a decoy — the whole point of the flag — made the corpus unloadable.

    So withholding propagates two ways, split on what structure.py treats as required:

    * a **required** reference to a withheld asset withholds the referrer too
      (:data:`_REQUIRED_TABLE_REFS`, via :func:`_withheld_closure`);
    * an **optional** one is pruned in place (:func:`_without_withheld_refs`).

    Provenance rides that same closure rather than adding a second pass, which matters more than
    it looks: a ``proposed`` *table* would otherwise leave every join on it unbindable and take
    the corpus to ``servable: false`` — the identical regression exclusion shipped with and paid
    for. Today's drafts are terms and few-shots, which nothing requires, so the closure is
    quiet; it is correct in advance of the case that would need it.

    One thing is deliberately *not* handled: a ``few_shot`` whose ``sql`` names an excluded
    table still ships, because that reference is non-fatal and pruning it would mean parsing
    SQL here. It teaches the model a query over a withheld table, which is a curation question
    rather than a loading one — worth deciding, not worth guessing at inside this function.

    not null — from all 8,106 rows of the six arms in ``runs/eval/``. That is worse than it
    sounds: ``measure/gates.py::_knobs_resolved_gate`` compares rows with ``row.get(key)``, so
    a key missing from every row compares equal to itself and the drift gate passes on a
    configuration it never saw.

    Three resolutions, in order:

    * **``UNSET`` becomes ``None``.** ``UNSET`` is not JSON and "this run had no calibrated
      value" is a measurement worth writing down. Readers are unaffected: ``int_knob`` and
      friends fall through a ``None`` to ``knob_default``, which is still ``UNSET`` and still
      raises rather than substituting a number.
    * **The policy, then the resolvers.** ``sqlglot_version``'s own note says it is UNSET
      "so it cannot be silently absent" and it was silently absent on every row;
      ``govern/functions.py`` has implemented exactly that resolver all along and nothing
      called it. Canonical function names are release-dependent and the ADR 0006 allowlist is
      keyed on them, so without it no artifact says which vocabulary the governance layer was
      enforcing. ``negative_tau`` stays ``None`` and that is the true value: the gate ships
      disabled and ``serve/nodes/negative.py`` writes ``"tau": None`` on every turn.
    * **The environment last**, because that is the order the readers use — see

    ``access_grant`` is resolved **from the policy and never from the register** (ADR 0012 §7).
    It is not in the tuple below because it is not a knob the policy happens to carry: it is a
    value type whose *digest* is the comparability fact, and the register's default is ``None``
    precisely so that a run whose policy was never threaded records an absence rather than the
    open grant's digest. Resolving it from :func:`~governed_bi.register.knobs.knob_default`
    would publish "open" for a fork shipping a restriction — the ``agent_recursion_limit``
    defect in the security register, which is what §3.10 of open-work.md is a whole section
    about.
