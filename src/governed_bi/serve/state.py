    """Everything a client is allowed to write into the graph. Deliberately one key.

    The write half of the trust boundary — audit-2026-08-10 §A2/§A3, which measured a client
    forging ``licensed``, ``corpus_content_hash`` and ``identity`` straight into ``ServeState``.

    ``trust()`` forces run constants over a caller's ``configurable``, but the graph's own
    ``input`` is a second write channel: ``langgraph_api`` forwards the client's dict unfiltered,
    ``PER_TURN_RESET`` does not clear :data:`TEST_HOOKS`, and ``int_knob`` reads state *before*
    ``knobs_resolved`` — so a request could set ``route_top_n`` while the record published the
    default. ``input_schema`` drops undeclared keys at the entry; measured on langgraph 1.2.10,
    ``route_top_n=99`` reaches the first node as absent, not as 99.

    Only the ``accept`` variant gets this. ``build_graph()`` without ``accept`` is entered by
    ``serve/__main__``, ``eval/`` and ``/chat``, which build the turn in-process through
    ``Session.turn()`` and legitimately pass the whole of :class:`ServeState`.

    """What ``invoke`` hands back — **the ``invoke`` half only** of the read boundary.

    Two keys, matching what the interface consumes: the transcript the SDK reconciles, and the
    turn's whole result. Adding a key here is the deliberate act.

    **``output_schema`` narrows ``invoke``**, and audit-2026-08-10 §B1 is about what it does *not*
    narrow. Two measurements on langgraph 1.2.11, of two different things, and the difference
    matters:

    - the compiled ``accept`` graph's ``stream_channels_asis`` is all **47** declared channels;
    - but the root ``values`` frames of an actual streamed run carried **only** ``answer`` and
      ``messages`` — 4 frames, 0 containing ``turns``, measured over the wire from the client.

    So the graph *attribute* is wide and the frames are not. ``get_state(...)`` and
    ``GET /threads/{id}/state`` **are** wide: both return ``identity`` (the token
    :func:`~governed_bi.serve.resume.authorise_resume` gates clarification resume on) and
    ``delivery`` (the whole rendered corpus context block). This class is not a guarantee about
    either surface.

    Count went 46 → 47 with :attr:`ServeState.turns`. That channel widens the §B1 remainder on the
    **checkpoint-read** surfaces and not on the streamed one: what escapes there is one
    ``answer["record"]`` per read today and every prior turn's record once ``turns`` is present.
    Since ``GET /threads/*`` requires no credential (finding A7), that is the surface to price.
