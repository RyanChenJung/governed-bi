"""Serve one question and print what was recorded. ADR 0005 §2.8.2.2.

**This is a skeleton, not a demo, and the difference is the exit code.** It exits non-zero
when ``missing_required(record)`` is non-empty, and it names the fields. An entry point that
prints a plausible answer and exits 0 is indistinguishable from one that works — which is the
failure this repository keeps rediscovering in new costumes: ``STUB_ANSWER`` reaching an
artifact, ``ex=1.00`` from zero executions, a degradation gate passing with no index.

It also refuses to serve at all when the corpus reports a problem. ADR 0005 §2.8.2 requires an
unresolvable join endpoint to surface **where the corpus is built**, and until there was an
entry point there was no caller in a position to exit non-zero, so the requirement was
unsatisfiable rather than unsatisfied.

Usage::

    # a live schema: seed a corpus from it, write it, serve over it
    uv run --frozen python -m governed_bi.serve --schema gbi_demo_sales -q "how many customers?"

    # a corpus already on disk
    uv run --frozen python -m governed_bi.serve --corpus-dir corpus/ --schema gbi_demo_sales -q "..."

    # no model: the graph runs, retrieval and governance are real, the answer is the stub
    uv run --frozen python -m governed_bi.serve --schema gbi_demo_sales -q "..." --no-model

Credentials come from the environment or the git-ignored ``.env`` and are never printed.
