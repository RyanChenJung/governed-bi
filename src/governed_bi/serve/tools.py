    #: it re-takes the latch on the resume pass, and nothing gave the latch back. Measured: after
    #: "which year?" came back answered, the model's next ``ask_user`` was told "this turn already
    #: has one" outstanding, with the answer to that one sitting in the transcript directly above
    #: the refusal. The ``append`` still has to happen *before* ``interrupt()``, because that is
    #: the only point at which it can stop two concurrent ``Send``s; the release is the fix.

        """Pause and ask the human a clarifying question (HITL interrupt).

        ``question``/``why`` reach a business user, never an engineer — write them in
        plain language, with no table/column names, no dotted `table.column` paths, and
        no snake_case or camelCase identifiers. A leaked identifier is rejected before
        this pauses the turn; rephrase and call ``ask_user`` again. Write both in the same
        language the user's own question was asked in, never the corpus's or schema's
        language.

        ``basis`` states which of two reasons made you call this tool, so the answer can
        be routed correctly afterwards:

        - ``"data_definition"`` — a missing fact about the schema or a business rule that
          has one right answer for everyone (e.g. how a column encodes a value, what
          counts toward a metric). The answer is a durable fact worth remembering for
          every future question, not just this one.
        - ``"ranking_ambiguity"`` — the question turns on a ranking or superlative
          ("best", "top", "most valuable") that more than one metric could reasonably
          mean. The answer is a choice for this turn only; a different user, or the same
          user on another day, may mean something else by the same word.

        ``choices`` offers 2-4 concrete, clickable candidate answers, each shaped
        ``{"id": ..., "label": ...}``. Pass it only when you can name candidates you have
        actually **grounded** — in columns or values you inspected via ``inspect_schema``
        or ``sample_rows``, or in the schema's own structure — never invented ones. Leave
        it ``None`` when nothing is genuinely grounded; free text alone is correct then.
        A malformed entry (missing or empty ``id``/``label``) is rejected the same way a
        schema-identifier leak is, before this pauses the turn.

        ``allow_freeform`` defaults to ``True`` and should almost always stay ``True`` even
        when ``choices`` is given, so a real answer outside the offered list still reaches
        you rather than being boxed out.

        Only one question may be outstanding per turn; a second call is refused with a reply
        rather than queued.
