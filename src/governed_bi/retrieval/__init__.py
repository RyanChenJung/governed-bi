"""RVGD retrieval (Analyst step 5).

Four retrieval modes, four-stage rerank, token-budgeted, Corrective-RAG
fallback:

- **R** exact (id / physical-name lookup)
- **V** semantic (vector index)
- **G** graph (neighborhood over the projected FK graph)
- **D** dictionary (term / synonym resolution)

Retrieves the **Facts + Inference tiers only** (loader contract); Audit and
``governance.excluded`` assets are never retrieved. The vector / BM25 indexes
are rebuildable projections under ``corpus/_generated/``.

This slice ships the deterministic lexical (BM25) channel plus the Ground
expansion; see ``rvgd.py``. The lexical channel has a **field-weight seam** to
lean matching onto the curated semantics (a table's description / grain, a
column's description) over the raw physical identifiers — held flat for now
(``_SEMANTIC_BOOST=1``) and left as a production-tuning knob (see ``rvgd.py``
TUNING). It tokenizes camelCase and stems simple plurals, and keeps matches under
**per-type budgets** so tables are never crowded out by a flood of matching
few-shots. Ground expansion also pulls in the
tables a retrieved few-shot's gold SQL references, and curator ``confidence`` is a
mild tie-breaker. On the multi-schema path, ``schema_router`` shortlists schemas
(single-pass docs, batched embeddings) and expands along curated joins before
``retrieve``. Semantic (V) fusion is optional via an embedder and its pull is
tunable (``vector_weight``); graph (G) and Corrective-RAG reranking are later slices.

Retrieval quality is measurable offline with ``eval/retrieval_eval.py`` (table
recall@k over gold SQL, no LLM): ``python -m governed_bi.eval.retrieval_eval``.
