"""What identifies one measurement run, and whether an artifact on disk shares that identity.

Two halves of one question, kept together because they have to agree: the driver *stamps*
the harness-side identity onto every row here, and *reads it back* here when ``--resume``
opens an artifact somebody else's run may have written.

**The incident.** ``--resume`` decided whether to keep an artifact from the artifact's
*filename*. The tag carries ``--model``, ``--effort``, ``--top-n``, ``--embed``, the provider
and ``--prompt-variant``; it carries no corpus, no dataset and no worker count, and an
explicit ``--out`` bypasses it entirely. So ``git pull`` in ``../BIRD-corpus``, resume, and one
artifact holds two corpora — with every quotability gate passing and the driver printing that
the numbers are quotable as a single arm. The corpus is the treatment identity (AGENTS.md),
which makes that the worst sentence the driver can print.

Both treatment hashes were already on every row. The half that was missing is a reader, and
the half that is added here is the rest of the identity: the harness commit, the worker count,
and which questions and schemas were served.

**Not a knob home.** ``register/knobs.py`` owns every knob's *declaration* and default; this
module only resolves the ones whose value is a fact about the running process — a git sha
cannot have a register default. Every name written here is declared there, and
``tools/check_declared_is_consumed.py`` rule K2 fails the build if one is not.

    **Why the two treatment hashes are not enough.** The filename tag is the only thing that

    Neither ``corpus_content_hash`` nor ``prompt_set_hash`` moves with ``--top-n``, ``--embed``,
    ``--reflect`` or the model id, so a resume under a renamed output file could merge two
    treatments with both hashes agreeing. These are the same keys
    ``eval/report.py::knobs_comparable`` compares across two arms; here they are compared
    across one artifact and the run about to extend it.

    ``repr`` rather than ``==``, for the reason the within-arm gate gives: ``3`` and ``"3"`` are
    two configurations, and a comparison that coerced them would report drift as agreement.

    **Through :func:`_json_shaped` first, or no artifact resumes (fixed 2026-08-22).** The
    artifact side has been through JSON, where a tuple comes back a list, so a knob whose value
    is a nested sequence could never compare equal to itself: ``asset_budgets`` resolves to a
    tuple of pairs, and ``--resume`` refused **every** artifact on that key alone, printing two
    lines of identical-looking values as the reason. That made the flag ``docs/measurement.md``
    prescribes for surviving a multi-hour arm ("expect to interrupt it and resume it")
    unusable, and the failure read as a real treatment drift rather than as a serialisation
    artifact. Canonicalising containers keeps the distinction the ``repr`` is here for -- ``3``
    and ``"3"`` still differ, and so do ``[1]`` and ``["1"]``.

    A key absent from every row **and** from this run is skipped — both sides declined to say.
    No live run is in that state: ``session._resolved_knobs`` omits no key, so this run always
    records all 47. Present on one side only is a **warning**: the likeliest cause is an
    artifact older than the knob, and refusing on it would strand every artifact on disk. That
    is the branch every artifact on disk hits — six comparability knobs are absent from all
    seven ``proxy_*`` artifacts in ``runs/eval/`` (``abstention_policy_enabled``,
    ``access_grant``, ``cost_budget``, ``negative_tau``, ``semantic_scale_ceiling``,
    ``sqlglot_version``) and recorded by any run that would resume one.

    "Absent" and "recorded ``None``" stay apart throughout, which is why membership is tested
    rather than ``.get()``: ``_resolved_knobs`` flattens ``UNSET`` to ``None`` on purpose, so a
    recorded ``None`` is a value two runs may agree on while a missing key is a run declining

    Asked **before the first paid question**, which is the only place the check is worth
    anything: a run labelled ``v4`` against a corpus that is not v4's is a mislabelled artifact,
    and mislabelled artifacts are how a number is quoted against the wrong treatment.

    ``session_identity`` is anything shaped like a measurement row — the driver passes
    ``{"corpus_content_hash": session.corpus_content_hash}``, which is why ``reconcile`` was
    written to read a row rather than a session.

    Extracted from ``main`` for the reason :func:`append_refusal` was: the driver reaches this
    point only after a corpus, a dataset, a database and four models are built, so the branch
    was unreachable from a test. It was also the wire that made ``reconcile`` non-vacuous, and
    an untested wire is exactly what let a vacuous ``reconcile`` through in the first place.
