"""The eval-ladder harness (Architecture section 8; D4; terminology-refactor).

Runs a set of questions through a *solver* (question -> SQL, or None if it
declines/refuses) and scores EX plus the free behavioral signals:

- **decoy-touch rate**: share of produced queries that reference a
  manifest-flagged fake column (Analyst "three points" #1 drives this to 0 in
  dev via the suspect hard-block). Computed here from the corpus suspect set.
- **governed-path adherence**: share of questions the solver actually answered
  (produced SQL for) rather than refused.

The eval ladder's fair rungs differ only by the corpus fed into the *same*
serve path: ``baseline`` (deterministic, DB-derivable corpus, no curator LLM),
``curated`` (curator-built Inference tier + train-SQL-derived assets), and
``curated_sme`` (``curated`` + Simulated-SME clarification rounds). ``baseline``
vs ``curated`` is the moat proof; ``curated`` vs ``curated_sme`` is the SME
lift. This module supplies the reusable scorer (``run_arm``) and
``agent_solver``, which drives the agentic serve core (ADR 0002) for every
fair rung — ``run_arms`` scores whichever rungs the caller supplies solvers for.
The ``ceiling`` rung (a test-aware oracle) is designed, not built (see
``docs/plans/terminology-refactor.md``); it intentionally has no ``Arm`` member
or solver here.

    Routes through ``answer_question_agent`` (the ``create_agent`` +
    governance-middleware path) — the one serve path shared by every fair rung
    of the eval ladder (``baseline`` / ``curated`` / ``curated_sme``). The outer
    rails graph is built once and invoked per question; each ``solve`` is
    independent (no working memory / cache), matching the single-round eval
    contract. ``last_solve_meta`` carries audit fields plus the
    governance-ledger length.

    Each question increments ``n_human`` and mints a fresh ``run_id`` (see
    ``ingest``) so portable run-log UPSERTs do not collapse an N-question run
    into one ``{session_id}:1`` row. Pass a distinct ``session_id`` per arm so
    arms do not collide either.

    Portable run logging is forced off here: eval metrics live in
    ``last_solve_meta`` / experiment rows. Opt in by passing settings with
    ``run_log_kind`` already set to a non-default destination via
    ``enable_run_log=True``.
