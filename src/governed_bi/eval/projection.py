"""Turn projection — shape a served turn's final state into a measurement row (ADR 0005 §4.1).

Split out of ``eval/harness.py`` by the 1000-line cap (ADR 0005 §6), which was forcing the
timing rather than the seam: that module is orchestration (drive a question through
``serve.compile_durable``, serially or across ``workers``) plus this file's job, which is pure
— given the state a turn ended in and the question it answered, shape the fixed-key row every
gate, grader and report reads. Nothing here calls the graph or touches a connector for anything
but the read-only re-execution that prices an abstention.

``project_turn`` is the public entry point and stays re-exported from ``eval.harness`` (which
imports it from here), so no existing ``from governed_bi.eval.harness import project_turn``
needs to change. Everything else is a private, single-purpose helper it calls.

    declined and never *which layer*. Reading the 2026-08-09 run therefore required replaying
    every refused statement through ``check()`` offline to learn that 18 of 21 were
    ``r_table_not_licensed`` — a retrieval failure the analysis had attributed to a
    guardrail false-positive. The field that would have said so already existed.

    **``executed_sql`` for the same reason, added 2026-08-24.** The turn record keeps every
