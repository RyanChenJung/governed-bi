"""Eval over the pooled BIRD data lake — one Postgres, 57 curated schemas, no pin.

**Two stages, cheap one first.** :func:`routing_recall` needs no model — with no extraction
model the facet queries fall back to the raw question — so it answers *is the gold schema
even a candidate* for free. The paid **live arm** (``harness.run_arm`` with ``arms.live_arm``,
driven by ``tools/run_datalake_eval.py``) runs second, because paying to discover the router
never shortlisted the right schema buys a result available for nothing.

**The reference for correctness is the gold result set, never the SQL string.** Each question
carries ``sql_rename``, the gold written against the obfuscated Postgres schemas; grading
executes both and compares fingerprints (:mod:`governed_bi.eval.grade`), so a different join
order is not a wrong answer.

:func:`observed_tokens` measures volume per stage and stops there. It does not convert to
money: a hand-maintained price table has to track a provider's list by hand, and the one that
lived here shipped a stale row that overstated a measured run nine-fold.

    A question whose ``db_id`` is not in the corpus is **not** an engine failure: the corpus
    covers 57 of the database's 70 schemas, so scoring the other 13 reports a curation gap as
    a retrieval gap. Filtered against the caller's declared schema set, so the exclusion count
    is the caller's.

    ``gold_sql`` comes from ``sql_rename``, written against the obfuscated schemas this
    database has. ``sql_base`` is the un-renamed original and ``sql_sqlite`` a different
    engine; either fails to execute here, and an unexecutable gold grades every prediction
    wrong.

    ``per_schema`` caps questions per schema — without it a sample is weighted by whichever
    schema BIRD asked most about, and a per-schema effect reads as an overall one.

    ``only_ids`` names the population exactly, for an arm whose question is about a *subpopulation*
    rather than a rate. Added 2026-08-24 to price the collapsed-list nudge
    (``serve/structured_check.py::collapsed_list_suffix``): it appends nothing on a statement that
    does not collapse, so a question it cannot fire on contributes an identical row to both arms
    and only spends money. 26 candidate questions instead of 120 is the same measurement.

    **It raises on an id the dataset does not carry**, and that is the whole reason it is a

    against a re-split dataset, would quietly change the population under a name that says

    """Where a question is lost, as **conditional** stages over one population.

    ``summarise_routing`` and ``table_coverage`` each report over all rows and nothing joins
    them, so unconditional coverage beside unconditional recall cannot distinguish *the router
    sent us to the wrong schema* from *the router was right and the budget cut the table we
    needed* — two findings that want opposite work.

    Each stage is conditioned on the one above it, and each carries its own denominator:

    ``schema_routed``
        gold ``db_id`` among the routed schemas. Unconditional.
    ``tables_in_routed_schemas``
        given that, every gold table lives in a routed schema. A drop here is a genuinely
        cross-schema question; on BIRD-obfuscated there are none.
    ``all_gold_tables_licensed``
        given that, every gold table survived pass two, the budget and ``connect``.
    ``answered``
        given a licensed set that could support an answer. The gap from the stage above is
        generation, the only one a corpus change cannot touch.
    ``graded`` / ``correct``
        given an answer this grader could judge at all. ``graded`` is the *instrument's* stage:
        a turn with no comparable gold is unmeasured, and keeping it out of EX's denominator is
        the difference between "the system was wrong" and "we did not look".

    Rates come from :meth:`~governed_bi.register.quantity.Measured.rate`, so a stage with no
    population reports *unmeasured* rather than ``0.000`` — the ``or 1`` idiom elsewhere in
    this module is what lets a zero-row coverage read as a real ceiling of zero.

    The stages above are over ``scorable``, which excludes golds that read no table. On the
    2026-08-07 pooled run that set is 127 of 1 351 and every arm does badly on it, so
    ``gold_reads_no_table`` is returned beside them with **its own EX** — published as a
    population rather than dropped, because an exclusion that lifts every arm by the same
    ~3 points is a reporting choice and the reader is the one who has to make it.
