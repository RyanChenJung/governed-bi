"""The curator build harness as a deepagents agent (D10; docs/curator.md).

The curator is the design's **maximum-autonomy** harness (opposite risk profile to
the fail-closed Analyst): it explores a database and authors the Inference-tier
semantic layer. That "explore + plan + act over many steps" shape is exactly what
``deepagents`` provides (planning tool, filesystem scratchpad via
``FilesystemBackend``), so the curator agent is a deep agent over a small set of
grounded tools:

- ``read_corpus`` — live Facts + Inference already written (filterable).
- ``run_probe_query`` — read-only SQL probe against the gateway.
- Six validated write tools (``upsert_*`` / ``annotate_*``) that mutate the
  in-memory :class:`~governed_bi.curator.asset_bag.AssetBag`.
- Built-in file tools (``ls``/``read_file``/``write_file``/``edit_file``/``grep``)
  via ``FilesystemBackend(run_dir)`` — **only** for ``clarifications.jsonl``.

Requires the ``agents`` extra (deepagents). Imported only here, so
``import governed_bi.curator`` never needs deepagents; use
``from governed_bi.curator.deep_agent import build_curator_agent``.
