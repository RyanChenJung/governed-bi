"""Curator: the build harness (``deepagents``).

The offline agent that *produces* the corpus, per-DB and independently. Not a
one-shot bootstrapper but a **permanent maintainer** (cold-start + drift-repair;
untended corpora rot ~95%→65%/month).

Proposer + adversary (D10): the proposer hypothesizes Inference-tier assets +
notes; an independent adversary tries to **refute** each before it commits
(``proposed -> draft``). **Facts** are generated programmatically and never
checked; the adversary boundary *is* the Facts/Inference boundary.

Modules map to the per-DB loop (``docs/curator.md``):

- ``profile``   - step 1: Facts tier, programmatic, no LLM.
- ``proposer``  - step 2: hypothesize Inference assets.
- ``adversary`` - step 3: refute each proposed asset.
- ``loop``      - steps 4-5: self-eval & repair, then propose corpus.
