"""Mine a mistake -> fix pair out of one turn's execution ledger (UtkuAI Round 6/8, ported).

**What "mistake" means here.** Not every retry is a mistake worth remembering — a turn whose
first attempt already passed has nothing to teach. This mines only the pattern that generalizes:
at least one attempt failed a governance layer or the connector, and a later attempt in the
*same turn* went on to pass. The corrected SQL becomes a :class:`~governed_bi.corpus.schema.FewShotAsset`
draft (submitted via :mod:`governed_bi.corpus.drafts`, never written directly), on the theory
Round I already tested and confirmed: a corrected example, retrieved for a semantically similar
future question, transfers the fix even across unrelated business topics.

Deliberately does not classify *why* the first attempt failed beyond naming the layer — that
is exactly the open-ended, no-hypothesis-needed shape Round 6's original mechanism had, and
Round H's structured check already covers the one specific, named failure mode (percentage
scaling) this module is not trying to duplicate.
