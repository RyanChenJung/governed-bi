"""Curator loop step 2 - Propose (Inference tier).

The proposer hypothesizes the **Inference tier** on top of the programmatic
**Facts tier** that ``profile.profile_database`` emits. Per D10
(``docs/curator.md``) Facts (dtypes, uniqueness, samples, row counts) are never
proposed and never checked; everything the proposer *asserts* is what the
adversary later tries to refute (``adversary.review``). The adversary boundary
*is* the Facts/Inference boundary.

A full LLM proposer (running on the ``deepagents`` harness, seeded with the DB's
train queries + BIRD ``evidence``) would additionally write column/table prose
descriptions, joins, reliability caveats, terms, metrics, and notes. This module
ships a deterministic :class:`HeuristicProposer` so the whole
proposer -> adversary -> promote loop runs with no network and no LLM. The
:class:`Proposer` protocol is the seam an LLM proposer plugs into.

The heuristic never fabricates prose it cannot know from Facts: it fills
``role``, ``confidence`` and provenance, and deliberately leaves ``description``
as ``None`` (that is the LLM proposer's job).
