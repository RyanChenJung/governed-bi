        "The SQL-writing agent's system prompt. Carries the two identifier rules whose absence "
        "made governance refuse for the wrong stated reason (ADR 0008 P8/D10). v3 is v2 plus "
        "result-shape guidance, because the grader hashes the result set and v2 says nothing "
        "about it: on a 1351-question BIRD run (engine d121c34, corpus 30872d3) 107 predictions "
        "over-projected and 51 of them (47.7%) became correct once the extra columns were "
        "dropped, while a repair sweep recovered 27 more by toggling DISTINCT — 15 by adding it, "
        "12 by removing it, which is why the DISTINCT rule is about intent and not a direction. "
        "**v3 is the default from 2026-08-09**: two arms, paired McNemar p = 0.0008 against "
        "run1 and p = 0.00008 against run2, with over-projection 107 -> 18 and every guardrail "
        "flat or better. Leaving v2 default meant an unflagged run served the worse wording. "
        "**v4 is the default from 2026-08-10, and not because it won on EX.** Against v3-fold "
        "it is net +16, p = 0.18 -- inside the noise. It is the default because its mechanism "
        "is unambiguous (r_star_projection 35 attempts over 29 turns down to 2 over 2, and "
        "r_column_not_allowed 22/13 down to 3/3), because it states a constraint the engine "
        "actually enforces, and because no guardrail moved: over-projection flat at 40 under, "
        "abstention precision unchanged inside its own error bar. A prompt that says what "
        "check() will refuse is right whether or not the score notices.\n"
        "v4 is v3 plus the star rule: `check()` refuses `SELECT *` at BINDING and the prompt "
        "had never said so, so the agent wrote it, was refused, and had nothing to go on -- 29 "
        "turns of the v3-fold arm, of which 1 ended correct, and 14 of the 48 questions WrenAI "
        "solves and we abstain on. The same shape as the identifier rules two paragraphs up: a "
        "constraint that exists, fires, and was never stated. `COUNT(*)` is named explicitly "
        "because it is the carve-out and an agent told only 'no star' would stop using it. "
        "Its worked example names no schema in the evaluation set on purpose: the rule is "
        "derived from measurement, which is the loop working, but an illustration borrowed from "
        "a held-out question's domain would let the prompt be read as tuned on the test split "
        "for no teaching value a neutral example does not have.\n"
        "v5 is v4 minus the projection paragraph, and it is the one variant here written to "
        "lose. The star rule and the identifier rules state constraints `check()` enforces; "
        "the projection rule states nothing this engine enforces -- `RULES` in `govern/layers.py` "
        "has no rule about how wide a select list may be -- while `result_fingerprint` hashes "
        "row tuples and explicitly does not hash column names, so an extra column can change "
        "nothing except the grader's digest. A rule aimed at the one dimension of the "
        "comparator, and at nothing else, is measuring the comparator. v5 prices it: the "
        "difference v4 - v5 is how much of this engine's EX comes from shaping output to a "
        "digest rather than from answering the question, and that number belongs in the write-up "
        "whichever way it falls. Its worked example told the agent to withhold the total from "
        "'which supplier shipped the most units', which is worse for a real BI reader -- so the "
        "rule is not obviously right on its own terms either.\n"
        "**v6-v9 are this fork's, renumbered from its own v3-v6 at the 2026-08-14 upstream "
        "merge.** Both lineages branch from v2 and share no text: this fork added clarification "
        "and language rules while upstream added result-shape and star rules, so `v3`, `v4` and "
        "`v5` had independently come to name three different prompts each -- and a variant key "
        "that names two prompts is exactly what this registry hashes names to prevent. "
        "Upstream's numbering is the one kept, because the McNemar figures above are published "
        "against it. **v9 is the default, and it is v2 plus this fork's three rules only**: it "
        "carries neither upstream's v3 DISTINCT/result-shape rule nor its v4 star rule, so none "
        "of the measurements quoted for those transfer to it, and the fork's own v6-v9 figures "
        "below were measured without them. Picking v9 here preserves the behaviour this fork "
        "measured rather than silently changing it at a merge.\n"
        "**v10 is that composition, and it is unmeasured.** It is v9 concatenated with exactly "
        "the suffix v4 adds to v2 -- both of upstream's tails, byte for byte, with "
        "`tests/conformance/test_the_composed_variant_is_its_two_parents.py` pinning the "
        "relationship so the 4,908 duplicated characters cannot drift into a second text. It is "
        "**not** the default and must not be promoted on the strength of the McNemar figures "
        "above: those were measured against upstream's v2, and v9 is a different base. One of the "
        "rules v9 adds changes *when the agent stops to ask instead of answering*, so a "
        "result-shape rule that pays on a prompt which answers immediately is not the same "
        "intervention on a prompt that pauses first -- it may be reached less often, or interact. "
        "The variant exists so that arm is a knob flip rather than a code change.\n"
        "v6 adds the only "
        "guidance anywhere on when to prefer ask_user over state_assumption (2026-08-07 Power "
        "Kiosk audit) — state_assumption existed but was never named here, so the two tools' "
        "split of labor was left entirely to the model's unguided judgment, and \"Who are our "
        "best customers?\" landed on either one non-deterministically across otherwise-identical "
        "runs instead of reliably asking which metric \"best\" means. v7 adds that ask_user "
        "now must self-report which of two ambiguity kinds triggered it, so a live-"
        "clarification-to-corpus mining step downstream can route data-definition answers "
        "into the shared corpus and keep ranking/superlative answers turn-scoped only. v8 fixes "
        "a live-observed bug where ask_user's question/why and state_assumption's text mirrored "
        "the corpus's language rather than the user's (an English \"Who are our best "
        "customers?\" against the German-language beer_factory corpus came back asking in "
        "German), and adds guidance for grounding ask_user's new choices argument so the "
        "UI's already-built multiple-choice clarification affordance finally gets fed. Its "
        "language rule was itself tuned against real Bedrock traffic on that exact case: a "
        "first wording, stated as a plain instruction, was still ignored 3/3 live runs; only "
        "putting it first, framing question/why/text as spoken-to-the-user rather than "
        "schema data, and giving one concrete worked example fixed it — and the example had to "
        "use a placeholder question, not the eval's own \"best customers\" wording, once an "
        "early draft that reused that exact phrase turned out to make the model echo the "
        "example rather than generalize the rule (verified by swapping in a differently-worded "
        "live question and watching it hold). v9 fixes the residual v8's own commit named but "
        "left open, re-measured live on 2026-08-11 (Bedrock, us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5): a "
        "live multi-tool-call turn (ask_user asked in English, answered in English, then "
        "inspect_schema, sample_rows and run_query ran before a final answer) came back in "
        "German 4/4 times on a freshly seeded corpus — not because the rule was violated, but "
        "because it was never in scope. v8's text names only ask_user's question/why and "
        "state_assumption's text; it says nothing about the turn's own closing prose, which is "
        "exactly what narrate_node adopts verbatim (serve/nodes/narrate.py) whenever the agent "
        "produces any text of its own, i.e. on most turns — NARRATE v2's language rule sits "
        "behind a branch that only runs when the agent's own loop ended in a bare tool call "
        "with no prose, so it never reaches the common case this bug lives in. A first v9 "
        "draft that only widened the rule's stated scope in prose (no new worked example) "
        "still drifted German 3/4 times live on that same scenario; adding a second worked "
        "example — the existing ask_user Japanese-suppliers example, extended one sentence to "
        "carry the same fictional case through several more tool calls to its closing answer "
        "— is what actually moved it, to 6/6 English on the original scenario and 2/3 on a "
        "harder supplementary one (a schema with three separate ambiguous-duplicate-column "
        "data-quality issues, each costing a query-attempt-cap slot before the real aggregation "
        "could run). Consistent with the v8 commit's own finding, once more: an abstract "
        "widening of the rule did not hold live; a concrete worked example did, mostly — not "
        "perfectly, which this repository records rather than smooths over.\n"
        "Separately, and *not* fixed by v9: the same 2026-08-11 re-testing also measured that "
        "v8's original fix is itself less reliable than its own commit reported, on this "
        "corpus specifically, for a reason that has nothing to do with prompt wording. The "
        "long-lived beer_factory corpus dir under runs/seeded-corpus/ still carries six "
        "clarification-mined \"term\" assets dated 2026-08-08 — the day before the v8 fix "
        "landed — whose body text preserves the original German ask_user questions those "
        "pre-fix turns produced (mine_corpus.py persists a clarification's Q as literally "
        "asked). Retrieval keeps surfacing them as \"Q: <German>\\nA: <English>\" context on "
        "every later turn that touches the same business terms, and the model appears to "
        "pattern-match that in-context exemplar shape rather than the system prompt's abstract "
        "rule: on that polluted corpus, asking \"Who are our best customers?\" in English came "
        "back with a German ask_user question 7/7 live runs across two batches, on both v8 and "
        "v9 (this fix does not touch ask_user's own wording, which v8 already tuned, and does "
        "not touch mine_corpus.py); on a freshly seeded corpus with none of those assets, the "
        "same question held English 4/5 at the ask_user step. That is a separate, unaddressed "
        "finding — a corpus mining/retrieval question, not a prompt one — and it is why every "
        "number above for v9's own fix comes from a freshly seeded corpus: measuring the "
        "final-answer fix on the polluted one would have conflated the two.\n"
        "**There is no v11, and that is a measured result rather than an omission "
        "(2026-08-20).** v9 names state_assumption only inside the ranking paragraph, as the "
        "branch you take *instead of* asking, so the tool is reachable only once the agent is "
        "already deciding whether to ask -- and the live reading is that a caveat it judged "
        "worth telling the reader often goes into the closing prose instead, where nothing "
        "records it. A candidate v11 was drafted against exactly that: one paragraph, checked "
        "right before the final answer, saying the closing prose and state_assumption are not "
        "alternatives, with a worked example in an unrelated domain (cancelled orders) because "
        "v8/v9 both found an example reusing the eval wording gets echoed rather than "
        "generalised. Measured live on app_store, 4 runs per arm of a question whose "
        "assumption is knowable from the schema alone (AVG over a column NULL on 1,474 of "
        "10,840 rows): the tool-call rate did not move, 1/4 to 1/4, and the prose caveat the "
        "reader *was* getting fell from 2/4 to 1/4 -- told that a note obliges a tool call, "
        "the model dropped the note. The same runs show the tool firing 2/2 on a question "
        "whose ambiguity only appears after inspect_schema and sample_rows, so the binding "
        "constraint is recognition, not channel, and one more paragraph here is not what "
        "moves it. Full method and artifacts: "
