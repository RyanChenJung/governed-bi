    The **recording** half of an env-first knob, and the reason it lives in the register
    rather than beside either reader: ``serve/graph.py`` and ``serve/nodes/agent_core.py``
    consult the variable before anything else, while ``session._resolved_knobs`` built the
    record from :func:`defaults` — so all three variables moved behaviour and left the
    artifact saying 120.0 / 1200.0 / 40.

    Two parsing rules are copied from those readers on purpose, because a record that
    disagreed with the reader would be the same defect wearing the opposite sign:

    * **Blank is unset.** ``graph.py`` tests ``if raw`` and ``agent_core.py`` tests
      ``str(raw).strip() != ""``; an exported-but-empty variable falls through to the knob.
    * **The declared default decides the type.** ``agent_recursion_limit`` defaults to an
      ``int`` and its reader calls ``int()``; the two timeouts default to ``float`` and their
      readers call ``float()``. Deriving the cast from the default is what stops the record's
      type drifting from the reader's when a default changes — ``_knobs_resolved_gate``
      compares by ``repr``, so ``40`` and ``40.0`` are two configurations.

    A value the reader would choke on raises here instead, at session construction, rather
    than mid-run in a node: the run is lost either way and the early failure names the
