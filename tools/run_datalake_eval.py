"""Run the pooled data-lake eval end to end. Crash-safe, resumable, bounded concurrency.

    uv run --frozen python tools/run_datalake_eval.py --workers 2 --effort xhigh --resume

In ``tools/`` rather than a scratchpad because the 1 351-question arm takes hours: it will be
interrupted, resumed, and re-read by someone who did not start it.

Three properties the earlier scratchpad driver lacked, each of which cost a run:

* **Rows are appended as they complete.** A driver that writes at the end is one interruption
  away from having measured nothing.
* **``--resume`` keeps what was measured and *retries what crashed*.** A crashed row is not a
  measurement, so skipping it bakes a permanent hole into the artifact and computes the final
  score over a denominator that silently included it.
* **Concurrency is bounded and declared.** ``--workers`` maps to ``harness.run_arm(workers=...)``,
  which gives each thread its own graph and connector. Default 2: three workers at ``xhigh``
  lost 30 of the first 194 questions to ``RateLimitError`` against a 500 k TPM ceiling, and a
  429 raised inside a node is caught by the graph wrapper and marked ``crashed`` — a lost
  measurement rather than a slow one. ``--max-retries`` (default 8) is the other half.

Never prints the DSN or the API key.
