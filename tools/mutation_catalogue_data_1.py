"""The catalogue's declared mutations, first half.

**Split out of ``tools/mutation_catalogue.py``** once that file reached 984 lines against ADR
0005 §6's hard 1000-line cap (``tools/check_file_length.py``) -- the cap forced the timing, not a
belief that this half deserved its own file on the merits. The catalogue itself is written as a
running log, one entry per audit finding in roughly the order each was found, not grouped by
parcel or defect class -- so there is no thematic seam to split along, only a line count. The
boundary here falls between ``p2-mispair-key-and-vector`` and ``m2-absent-count-passes-as-clean``,
which is exactly where the original tuple happened to sit at line 655 of 984. ``mutation_catalogue.py``
concatenates this and ``mutation_catalogue_data_2.py`` back into ``MUTATIONS`` in the original
order, so nothing about iteration order, ``--list``, or ``--only`` changes.

**A new entry appends to whichever of the two data files has the most room under the cap** --
check ``tools/check_file_length.py`` after adding one, and start a third file the same way once
both are full. Read ``tools/mutation_catalogue.py`` for what a run proves and what it does not.
