# Walkthrough: from clone to your first governed answer

_[English](walkthrough.md) · [简体中文](walkthrough.zh.md)_

A start-to-finish tour: install the repo, validate the example corpus, and ask
your first question — both over the HTTP API and from Python. Cloning, corpus
validation, and the test suite run **offline** (no API key, no network) against
the committed `beer_factory` database. Serve is **agent-only** (ADR 0002), so
asking a question needs a live model and fails closed without one — set an
OpenAI API key before step 4. A final step covers the model configuration and
a scripted live check.

By the end you'll have seen the two things that make this more than a
text-to-SQL demo: a **governed answer** (with its two-axis reliability stamp and
the exact SQL) and a **refusal** (fail-closed when a question is out of scope).

## 0. Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (the package manager / runner)
- Python 3.13 — uv fetches it automatically if you don't have it
- `git`

Required for step 4: an OpenAI API key. Serve is agent-only, so answering a
question needs a live model; the read-only audit endpoints (`/health`,
`/schema`, `/graph`, …) work with no key.

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Minhao-Zhang/governed-bi.git
cd governed-bi
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv`, installs the core dependencies, and installs
`governed_bi` in editable mode. Confirm it worked:

```bash
uv run python -c "import governed_bi; print(governed_bi.__version__)"
```

The committed `data/bird/beer_factory.sqlite` (a real BIRD database, CC BY-SA
4.0) means the full pipeline runs immediately — nothing to download.

## 2. Validate the corpus

The corpus is the governed semantic layer: Git-tracked YAML typed assets. The
validator checks ID conventions and reference integrity — a green run
is the "done-enough" signal for a corpus (D9).

```bash
uv run python -m governed_bi.corpus.cli
```

Expected output:

```
CI green: 17 assets, 0 findings.
```

(This same command runs in CI on every push.)

## 3. Run the tests

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

The suite is green offline. All **470** tests run by default (`uv run pytest`):
**462 pass** and **8 skip** — the skips are live-model-only checks (agent
generation quality), covered instead by `scripts/live_smoke.py`.

## 4. Ask your first question

There are two ways in: the HTTP API, and a few lines of Python. Both drive the
exact same governed Analyst flow.

### 4a. Over the HTTP API (recommended)

Serve needs a live model (there is no offline fallback for answering); the
read-only endpoints (`/health`, `/schema`, `/graph`, …) don't:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # read from the env, never stored in the repo
uv run uvicorn --factory governed_bi.api:create_app
```

This serves the governed API at http://localhost:8000 (interactive docs at
http://localhost:8000/docs). Ask your first question by POSTing to `/chat`:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/chat -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"What is the total revenue?"}'
```

You'll get a governed answer whose JSON carries (the agent core calls the
model to generate the SQL, so exact phrasing can vary run to run — this is a
representative example):

- **tier: governed**
- **safety_clearance: true**  ·  **semantic_assurance: grounded**
- the answer, e.g. `total_revenue = 18496.0`
- the SQL it ran, e.g. `SELECT SUM(PurchasePrice) AS total_revenue FROM "transaction"`
- a **provenance** trace (route, metric, tables, join confidence)

Now ask something the semantic layer does **not** cover:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/chat -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"How many employees work at the factory?"}'
```

Instead of guessing, the system **refuses**:

- **tier: refused**
- an escalation message: _"This question is outside the governed semantic
  layer. Contact the data owner to add coverage."_
- no SQL, no number

That refusal is the point: there is no employee/payroll data in scope, so a
governed system says so rather than inventing a plausible-but-wrong number.

The API is stateless — to keep a conversation going, send prior turns back as
`history` (with a stable `session_id`) on the next `/chat` request.

### 4b. From Python

The same flow as a small API you could embed in your own app. It needs a live
model — the raw LangChain model is passed in as `model=`:

```python
from governed_bi.config import Settings, Environment
from governed_bi.corpus import load_corpus
from governed_bi.gateway import SqliteConnector, Gateway, Identity
from governed_bi.llm import LangChainChatClient
from governed_bi.analyst.agent import answer_question_agent

settings = Settings.for_env(Environment.dev)
corpus = load_corpus("corpus", schema="beer_factory").for_analyst()
conn = SqliteConnector("data/bird/beer_factory.sqlite")
chat = LangChainChatClient.from_config(settings.models)  # needs OPENAI_API_KEY

ans = answer_question_agent(
    "What is the total revenue?",
    Identity(user="demo", all_access=True),
    corpus=corpus,
    gateway=Gateway(conn),
    settings=settings,
    session_id="demo",
    model=chat.model,  # the raw LangChain model the agent core drives
)
print(ans.tier.value)            # governed (usually — live-model output can vary)
print(ans.safety_clearance)      # True
print(ans.semantic_assurance.value)  # grounded / heuristic
print(ans.sql)                   # e.g. SELECT SUM(PurchasePrice) AS total_revenue FROM "transaction"
print(ans.text)                  # e.g. total_revenue = 18496.0
conn.close()
```

## 5. What you're looking at

- **The two-axis stamp is the honest part.** `safety_clearance` is a gate — did
  the SQL pass all five guardrail layers and execute as the requesting principal?
  `semantic_assurance` (`grounded` / `heuristic` / `unverified`) is *how
  well-grounded* the answer is. They are kept separate on purpose: a query can be
  perfectly safe and still be the wrong computation, so "safe" is never read as
  "correct". (See [Analyst](analyst.md).)
- **You can audit the SQL.** The model's output is treated as untrusted; what
  actually ran is shown, and it only touches columns/tables the corpus licenses.
- **The refusal is a feature.** Missing coverage, a tripped guardrail, or a
  curated out-of-scope pattern all fail closed. The counterweight — not refusing
  answerable questions — is measured by the eval's false-refusal rate.

## 6. Model configuration and the live smoke script

Prefer a file over exporting the key? Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repo
root and put it there instead — it's loaded on import and never overrides a
variable already set in your shell. `.env` holds **secrets only**; policy
(models, datasource, corpus path) lives in
[`governed_bi.toml`](../governed_bi.toml) / `governed_bi.local.toml`.

The model is `gpt-5.6-luna` at low reasoning effort (configured in
[`governed_bi.toml`](../governed_bi.toml); fall back to `gpt-5.5` if your
account is GA-only), called through LangChain's `ChatOpenAI`, which routes
reasoning models to the OpenAI **Responses API**. Over `/chat`, follow-ups
resolve against the conversation (prior turns are fed back through the
engine's working memory), the answer is phrased in **natural language**, and
the executed rows are returned in the response's **result** field — the
executed rows are always carried on the answer.

For a scripted live check that prints execution accuracy, refusal, and
decoy-touch over `beer_factory`, run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/live_smoke.py
```
