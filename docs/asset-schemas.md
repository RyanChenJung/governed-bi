# Agentic BI Asset Schemas

_[English](asset-schemas.md) · [简体中文](asset-schemas.zh.md)_

The per-asset YAML field spec for the [Agentic BI System](system-overview.md)
corpus. Concretizes **D9** in [Design decisions](design-decisions.md) (Git+YAML
typed assets, curator-authored / human-audited); storage rationale in
[Architecture](architecture.md) §5; term definitions in [Glossary](glossary.md).
Adapted from *《从数据到智能》* Ch.3, with the authoring model inverted.

> This is the canonical field spec. The Pydantic implementation lives in
> [`src/governed_bi/corpus/schemas.py`](../src/governed_bi/corpus/schemas.py);
> ID conventions in [`ids.py`](../src/governed_bi/corpus/ids.py); the CI
> reference-integrity checker in
> [`validate.py`](../src/governed_bi/corpus/validate.py).

## Two principles (the backbone)

- **P1: Three field tiers.** Every asset's fields split into **Facts** (read from the catalog/data, never inferred), **Inference** (curator writes; this is the semantic layer), and **Audit** (why the inference was made, for reference only). Different tiers follow different rules (below).
- **P2: Universal fields, project-specific values only.** No field name is ever BIRD-specific. BIRD, enterprise deployments, and any future project share the *exact same schema*; only the values (which DB, which SQL dialect, which `source_refs`) differ. BIRD-eval-specific rules (e.g. leakage guards) live in the eval harness, never in the schema.

## One representation: everything is a typed YAML asset

Earlier revisions of this spec split the corpus in two: YAML typed assets for structured, per-entity content, and Markdown "skills" for prose, cross-entity, procedural content (routing triggers, gotchas, query patterns, domain overview) — on the theory that you can't CI-check or graph-project a prose blob, and can't cleanly express *"IF the question is about revenue, start from the transaction fact table, DO NOT use the brand list price"* in a per-column field.

**D17 folds that split away.** The `skill` asset type is deleted. `RuleAsset` generalizes into `NoteAsset`: one governed, typed asset that carries exactly that cross-entity procedural content — but as a CI-checked, indexed, governance-eligible corpus asset instead of an ungoverned Markdown side-channel that nothing validated or created programmatically. A note stays cross-entity (its `scope` can span several tables, an entire schema, or the whole DB) and still references other assets by id rather than duplicating their data; progressive disclosure survives too, just as one field split (`summary` always-visible, `body` on demand) instead of two file formats. See **Asset: `note`** below and **D17**.

> **Notes are the highest-value output, and curator-only**
>
> Anthropic's result on this class of procedural knowledge: same model,
> **<21% without it, 95%+ with it**. That's the single biggest lever. Notes
> have **no oracle counterpart** (nothing built derives them for any rung of
> the eval ladder), so even the `ceiling` rung has no notes. That is exactly
> why the `curated` arm can *beat* the recoverable ceiling on note-sensitive
> questions (D4).

## The consumption contract (who reads which tier)

| Consumer | Facts | Inference | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Analyst** (SQL generation) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ **never injected** |
| **Viz / audit surface** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Retrieval index** (R/V/G/D) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

The loader enforces the contract: the Analyst's context is built from Facts + Inference only. Audit-tier prose (evidence, provenance) can therefore be as verbose as humans need without costing the Analyst tokens or adding noise. If Audit ever bloats the files, the escape hatch is a sidecar (not needed at BIRD scale).

## Governance overrides (human-authored, outside the three tiers)

One field is authored by neither the catalog nor the curator, but by a **human owner** (D6): `governance.excluded`. On a column or table, when a human sets it `true` after review, the asset is **removed entirely** from everything the Analyst sees (retrieval, the presented schema, the graph) in **all environments, no toggle, permanently**. It is still shown in the viz/audit surface (marked, with reason) so the exclusion is auditable, and guardrail L3 hard-blocks it as defense-in-depth.

```yaml
# on tbl_beer_factory_transaction, column CreditCardNumber
governance:
  excluded: true
  reason: "PII (payment card number); never surface to the Analyst"
  by: minhaoz
  at: "2026-07-08"
```

Distinct from the curator's `reliability.status: suspect`:

| | `reliability: suspect` | `governance.excluded` |
|---|---|---|
| Author | curator (AI), adversary-checked | human owner (certified) |
| Means | "looks unreliable" | "decided: never use" |
| Serve effect | soft-warn or hard-block (env-toggle) | **removed entirely**, all envs, no toggle |

Escalation path: curator flags `suspect` → human reviews (D6) → leaves it, or escalates to `excluded`. Kept **out of the autonomous eval ladder** (so the `curated` arm stays pure-curator); it's the human-in-the-loop governance capability for enterprise deployments.

## Clarifications (an Audit-tier block, D12)

A curator that cannot resolve a question from Facts + the batch **records it instead of guessing**, as a `clarification` block on the asset's **Audit tier**. Because it is Audit-tier, it is **never injected into the Analyst's context** (per the consumption contract above) — an open question cannot leak into SQL-gen or retrieval. While a question is open the asset still serves a best-effort answer from its Inference tier (low `confidence` + a `suspect` caveat); a **Responder** (a human **SME** in prod, a **Simulated SME** in eval) answers it, and `accept_answer` flips it to `answered`, re-stamping provenance. See [D12](design-decisions.md#d12-clarification-protocol).

```yaml
# on any asset, under its audit block
audit:
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
  clarification:
    question: "Is `kunde_id` the customer id, or an internal account id?"
    status: open            # open | answered
    asked_by: curator
    answer: null            # a Responder's free-text reply, once given
    answered_by: null       # the SME / responder id
    at: null                # ISO timestamp when answered
```

> Note: this per-asset `Clarification` (schema-embedded, `corpus/schemas.py`) is distinct from the curator's run-time `clarifications.jsonl` **ledger** (`curator/clarifications.py`) that the SME round-trip actually iterates. The ledger drives the batch round-trip; this block is the durable, ID-tracked record on the asset it concerns.

## Directory layout

```
corpus/
  <schema>/
    tables/      tbl_<schema>_<name>.yaml      # columns inline
    joins/       join_<left>_<right>.yaml
    few-shots/   fs_<schema>_<n>.yaml
    terms/       term_<name>.yaml
    metrics/     metric_<name>.yaml
    notes/       note_<name>.yaml
    negatives/   neg_<schema>_<n>.yaml
  _generated/    # search index, embeddings, compiled graph (derived, gitignored, rebuildable)
```

> **D15**: the corpus namespace `<schema>` (directory above, ID formats below) models a **schema**, not a database — one database holds many schemas, and cross-schema joins run as qualified `schema.table` SQL. The field/dir is named `schema` (the `db` → `schema` rename **shipped**, D15 increment 7); IDs are `tbl_<schema>_<name>`.

## ID conventions (CI regex-checked)

| Asset | ID format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| table | `tbl_<schema>_<name>` | `tbl_beer_factory_customers` |
| column *(inline; id derived by loader)* | `col_<schema>_<table>_<physical>` | `col_beer_factory_customers_CustomerID` |
| join | `join_<left>_<right>` | `join_transaction_customers` |
| few_shot | `fs_<schema>_<n>` | `fs_beer_factory_001` |
| term | `term_<name>` | `term_revenue` |
| metric | `metric_<name>` | `metric_revenue` |
| note | `note_<name>` | `note_boolean_flags` |
| negative_example | `neg_<schema>_<n>` | `neg_beer_factory_001` |

The **physical ↔ meaning bridge** runs through every table/column: `physical_name` is the identifier as it exists in the live DB (obfuscated for BIRD, cryptic in enterprise data). SQL emits this; the Inference tier carries the *meaning*. The curator's whole job is filling meaning for cryptic physical names, and this is identical in BIRD and enterprise deployments.

## Asset: `table` (with inline columns)

```yaml
# tables/tbl_beer_factory_customers.yaml
asset_type: table

    governance: { excluded: false }    # human sets true → asset removed everywhere the Analyst sees
    # Audit
    audit:
      reliability_evidence: "declared INTEGER; east-coast ZIPs with leading zeros cannot round-trip"
      provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }

# ── Audit (table-level) ──
audit:
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
```

## Asset: `join` (FK is inferred; BIRD withholds it)

```yaml
# joins/join_transaction_customers.yaml
asset_type: join
id: join_transaction_customers

# ── Facts (the referenced physical columns exist in the catalog) ──
left_table: tbl_beer_factory_transaction
right_table: tbl_beer_factory_customers
on: "transaction.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID"   # physical names

# ── Inference (the EXISTENCE of the edge is inferred) ──
cardinality: many_to_one               # inferred from uniqueness of the right key
cost: 1.0                              # Steiner-planner input (derivable from cardinality × row_counts)
confidence: 0.95

# ── Audit ──
audit:

```

## Asset: `few_shot`

```yaml
# few-shots/fs_beer_factory_001.yaml
asset_type: few_shot
id: fs_beer_factory_001

# ── Facts ──
schema: beer_factory

# ── Inference (curator selects/distills; Analyst-consumed as a prompt exemplar) ──
question: "Which root beer brand has the highest average review rating?"
sql: |
  SELECT b.BrandName, AVG(r.StarRating) AS avg_rating
  FROM rootbeerreview AS r
  JOIN rootbeerbrand AS b ON r.BrandID = b.BrandID
  WHERE r.StarRating IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY b.BrandName
  ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
bound_terms: [brand, rating]
complexity: medium                     # simple | medium | complex → controls injection count
confidence: 0.9

# ── Audit ──
audit:
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
  # NB: the BIRD eval harness's CI additionally checks source_refs ⊆ train split (leakage guard).
  # That is a harness rule, not a schema rule (P2).
```

## Asset: `term` (synonyms + relationships inline)

```yaml
# terms/term_revenue.yaml
asset_type: term
id: term_revenue

# ── Inference (curator maps business language → assets) ──
name: "revenue"
synonyms: ["sales", "total sales", "gross revenue"]
binding: { asset_type: metric, asset_id: metric_revenue }
related_terms:                         # projects into the graph
  - { id: term_brand, relation: uses }   # relation: synonym_of | broader_than | uses
confidence: 0.75

# ── Audit ──
audit:
  evidence: "'revenue'/'sales' used interchangeably across seed questions; all map to SUM(PurchasePrice)"
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
```

## Asset: `metric` (inline rules; no per-asset gold, D4)

```yaml
# metrics/metric_revenue.yaml
asset_type: metric
id: metric_revenue

# ── Inference (curator derives from evidence + seed queries) ──
name: "total revenue"
base_table: tbl_beer_factory_transaction
expression: "SUM(PurchasePrice)"       # in meaning; SQL-gen maps to physical
dimensions: [customer, brand, transaction_date]
rules:
  - { kind: filter, note: "count only completed sales (all rows in transaction)" }
confidence: 0.75

# ── Audit ──
audit:
  evidence: "PurchasePrice is the per-sale amount; recurring SUM over sales in seed queries"
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft, version: "0.1.0" }
```

## Asset: `note` (governed annotation; D17)

Replaces the old standalone `rule` asset and the untyped `skills/*.md` surface.
A "rule" is a note with `activation=always` and `normative_force=must_honour`.
Routing / gotchas / patterns are notes too (formerly Markdown skills).

| `kind` | default `activation` | default `normative_force` |
|---|---|---|
| `business_rule`, `constraint` | `always` | `must_honour` |
| `context`, `domain_overview` | `always` | `advisory` |
| `routing`, `gotchas`, `pattern` | `on_match` | `advisory` |

Both defaults are overridable (e.g. a keyword-triggered `business_rule` can be
`activation=on_match` + `normative_force=must_honour`). Phase 1 injects only
`activation=always` notes, and only their `summary` (never `body`). `on_match`
PIN, body fetch, and `read_notes` / `grep_notes` are Phase 2.

A `Trigger` is `{ kind: keyword | regex, value: <string> }`. A firing trigger
**pins** its note into the shortlist outright rather than contributing a
lexical score to RRF (fusing weak lexical signal into RRF measurably hurt
recall — see ADR 0003). `regex` is modeled now but only `keyword` fires today;
regex-over-the-question is deliberately deferred (`grep_notes`, Phase 2,
covers regex-over-*text* without that dependency).

`scope` entries are asset ids, or namespace sentinels `schema:<name>` /
`db:<name>`; `[]` means global. Asset ids never contain `:`.
`publication_status` is serve-visible (survives `for_analyst`); CI flags drift
against `audit.provenance.status` when Audit is present.

```yaml
# notes/note_boolean_flags.yaml
asset_type: note
id: note_boolean_flags

# ── Inference ──
kind: business_rule
scope: [tbl_beer_factory_rootbeerbrand]   # [] = global; also schema:… / db:…
summary: >
  The ingredient and availability flags on rootbeerbrand (CaneSugar, CornSyrup,
  Honey, ArtificialSweetener, Caffeinated, Alcoholic, AvailableInCans,
  AvailableInBottles, AvailableInKegs) are stored as the TEXT strings 'TRUE' and
  'FALSE', not as integers or booleans; filter with = 'TRUE', never = 1.
# body: |                                 # optional long form; on-demand only (Phase 2)
# triggers: [{ kind: keyword, value: "TRUE" }]   # authored now; PIN wired in Phase 2
activation: always                        # default from kind; overridable
# normative_force defaults to must_honour for business_rule
confidence: 0.85
publication_status: draft                 # proposed | draft | certified
# related_notes: [note_other]
# governance: { excluded: false }

# ── Audit ──
audit:
  evidence: "sampled values are the literal strings 'TRUE'/'FALSE' in TEXT columns"
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
```

## Asset: `negative_example`

Marks a question class as **unanswerable from this data** → fires the refuse-gate's canned escalation (D5). Curator-proposed from self-eval coverage gaps (dev) or owner-curated (prod); adversary-checked; matched at serve time by semantic similarity.

```yaml
# negatives/neg_beer_factory_001.yaml
asset_type: negative_example
id: neg_beer_factory_001

# ── Inference (curator proposes; human certifies) ──
pattern: "questions about employees, staffing, or headcount"
example_questions:
  - "How many employees work at the factory?"
  - "What is the average salary of factory staff?"
reason: "no table in this database covers employees, staffing, or payroll"
escalation: "not answerable from this data - contact <owner>"
confidence: 0.8

# ── Audit ──
audit:
  evidence: "self-eval questions about staffing found no covering table"
  provenance: { source: curator, status: draft }
```

---

## CI reference-integrity (the "done-enough" signal)

CI validates the corpus and its pass doubles as the curator's machine-checkable stop signal (D9):

- **ID regex**: every `id` matches its convention.
- **Physical existence**: every `physical_name` / `on` column exists in the live catalog.
- **Reference resolution**: `references`, `binding.asset_id`, `related_terms[].id`, `metric.base_table`, `note.scope[]` all resolve to existing assets (including `schema:` / `db:` sentinels).
- **Note publication drift**: when a note has Audit, `publication_status` must match `audit.provenance.status`.
- **Always-note budget**: at most 8 global `activation=always` notes and at most 2000 chars of always-note `summary` text.
- **Enum validity**: `role`, `reliability.status`, `logical_type`, `complexity`, `cardinality`, `relation`, `kind` ∈ their allowed sets.
- *(Eval-harness layer, not schema)*: few-shot `source_refs ⊆ train split` (leakage guard).

## Graph projection (all derived from YAML; Neo4j never authored)

| Edge | From → To | Sourced from |
|---|---|---|
| `HAS_COLUMN` | Table → Column | inline `columns[]` |
| `JOINS_TO` | Table → Table (props: on, cardinality, cost) | `join` |
| `REFERENCES` | Column → Column | `column.references` |
| `BINDS_TO` | Term → Metric/Table/Column | `term.binding` |
| `SYNONYM_OF` / `BROADER_THAN` / `USES` | Term → Term | `term.related_terms[]` |
| `DERIVED_FROM` | Metric → Table/Column | `metric.base_table` / expression |
| `SCOPES` | Note → scoped asset id | `note.scope[]` |

BIRD uses an in-memory graph (networkx) for Steiner planning; Neo4j is the optional enterprise-scale projection.

## Curator vs the retired gold filler

- **Curator (the `curated` arm)** fills the Inference tier by *inference*: descriptions, roles, `references`, `reliability`, `confidence`, with `audit.*_evidence` recording why.
- There is no manifest-based oracle filler for the Inference tier anymore. A retired de-obfuscation "gold" arm once filled the *same* Inference fields deterministically from the manifests (real names via the rename map, the original-schema FK graph, and any `reliability.status=suspect` flags the manifest recorded), with `provenance.source: gold`, `confidence: 1.0` — it is **removed**: it was never a true ceiling, since curator notes could exceed it on note-sensitive questions. (`ProvenanceSource.gold` survives in the schema only as a legacy enum value.)
- Facts are identical across every rung of the eval ladder (read from the catalog); only Inference (including notes) varies.
- **Notes are curator-authored**: nothing else in the ladder derives them, including the designed-but-not-built `ceiling` rung's test-aware Simulated SME. This is the mechanism by which the `curated` arm can *exceed* even the recoverable ceiling on note-sensitive questions.
