# governed-bi design

_[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh.md)_

Design for an agentic BI / Generative-BI system: natural-language questions →
grounded, governed, auditable answers over enterprise relational data.

Near-term target is a **SQLite-proven showcase** (with dialect-pluggable seams
for other engines) that grows a reviewable semantic layer from a seed of
known-good queries — *seed-assisted growth*, not a zero-prior cold start.
Enterprise abstractions are seamed in but toggled off. Evaluated on the
self-built [BIRD-Obfuscation](https://github.com/Minhao-Zhang/BIRD-Obfuscation) dataset (execution accuracy; cost logged).

## Read in this order

1. [System overview](system-overview.md): what this is, the two harnesses, status.
2. [Architecture](architecture.md): the full design (spine, kernel, services, storage, flow, eval, environments).
3. [Design decisions](design-decisions.md): D1-D18 (+ 2026-07-15 audit dispositions) as ADRs, with alternatives and trade-offs.
4. [Asset schemas](asset-schemas.md): the per-asset YAML field spec (Facts / Inference / Audit tiers).
5. [Curator](curator.md): the build-side proposer + adversary loop. For the exact prompts, see [Curator LLM-call walkthrough](curator-llm-call.md).
6. [Analyst](analyst.md): the serve-side governed agentic core + guardrails. For the exact prompts, see [Analyst LLM-call walkthrough](analyst-llm-call.md).
7. [Viz](viz.md): the read-only audit surface — the presenter view models plus the `governed_bi.api` HTTP API to browse the layer and chat with the governed Analyst (the interactive UI is a separate project).
8. [Glossary](glossary.md): canonical terms.

[External design sources](references.md) that ground the design.

## Using the repo

The design docs above describe the intended system. For what actually runs
today (the corpus layer and the dev workflow):

- [Walkthrough](walkthrough.md): clone → validate → ask your first question. **Start here.**
- [Usage](usage.md): install, the validate CLI, and the programmatic corpus API.
- [Corpus authoring](corpus-authoring.md): write and validate corpus assets step by step.

## The spine (non-negotiables)

- **Two planes.** A semantic/control plane (versioned config + markdown, published via PR/CI) stays separate from a data plane that executes only guardrail-passed SQL. Meaning is defined once and owned by humans.
- **Authority is deterministic; reasoning may be agentic.** The question can be wide and the model reasons in a bounded agentic loop, but *what may execute, what is trusted, and what is recorded* is fixed by middleware, not model discretion (ADR 0002 reversed the earlier "never an autonomous loop" rule). The SQL must be narrow.
- **Fail-closed.** Out-of-scope / missing-coverage / tripped-guardrail returns a refusal or a clarifying question, never a confident wrong number.
