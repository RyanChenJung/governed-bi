# Agentic BI Architecture

_[English](architecture.md) · [简体中文](architecture.zh.md)_

Full design for the [Agentic BI System](system-overview.md). Terms are in the
[Glossary](glossary.md). The reasoning and alternatives behind each choice are
in [Design decisions](design-decisions.md).

## 1. Design Spine (Non-negotiables)

1. **Two planes.** A semantic/control plane holds business meaning as versioned config and markdown, published offline via PR/CI. It stays separate from a data plane that executes only guardrail-passed SQL. Meaning is defined once and owned by humans.
2. **Serve's *authority* is deterministic; its *reasoning* may be agentic.** The question can be wide, but the SQL must be narrow. Authority (what may execute, what is trusted, what goes recorded) is hard-wired and auditable; the reasoning that finds the answer may run as a bounded agentic loop confined to governed, read-only tools. [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) reverses the earlier "never an autonomous ReAct loop" form of this spine, now implemented as the sole serve path, separating autonomy-in-reasoning from autonomy-in-authority; only the latter stays forbidden.
3. **Fail-closed.** Out-of-scope, missing-coverage, or tripped-guardrail returns a refusal or a clarifying question, never a confident wrong number.

## 2. Two Harnesses over One Shared Substrate

Curator and Analyst have opposite risk profiles. They use different harnesses but share everything below the loop.

| | Curator (build) | Analyst (serve) |
|---|---|---|
| Output | a durable artifact (the corpus) | an answer to a user |
| Checked by | a human, before it ships | nobody (the user can't verify) |
| Failure cost | cheap, recoverable | catastrophic (silent wrong answer) |
| Autonomy | maximum (explore) | minimum (fail-closed) |
| Harness | `deepagents` | `LangGraph` + middleware |

*Built:* both harnesses are installed by a plain `uv sync` (no extra), over LangChain-backed model clients. The Analyst is the [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) governed agentic core, `analyst.agent` (thin outer deterministic rails wrapping a `create_agent` reasoning loop governed by middleware; the module was `server/`, renamed `analyst/` post-cutover — "server" now names infra only: `LangGraph Server`, the HTTP/ASGI process). It has been the sole serve path since the P2 cutover; the earlier deterministic flow (`server.flow::answer_question`) and the stale, unused `server.graph` DAG were deleted under the old module name, before that rename. No live model is fail-closed: `build_stack()` still builds offline for the read-only audit API, but the serve process raises at startup and `/chat` returns 503 until a model is configured. The first live A/B against the (now-removed) deterministic flow motivated [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) Amendment 1; current eval numbers are in [experiment results](plans/eval-ladder-results.md). Curator = `curator.deep_agent` (a deepagents agent over Facts-profiling + read-only-probe tools, construction verified offline, live run model-gated).

> **Curator = permanent maintainer**
>
> Not a one-time bootstrapper. Cold-start is its first job, but drift-repair is
> ongoing. Untended corpora rot (~95%→65% in a month per *How Anthropic enables
> self-service data analytics with Claude*). Full loop (proposer and adversary):
> [Curator](curator.md).

## 3. Kernel Primitives (Survive model improvement)

- **Governed gateway**: read-only, RLS-as-user, credential-isolated, forced LIMIT/timeout, audit/replay. It can access everything, but a context layer routes to governed datasets first. Ideally raw tables are never touched.
- **Agentic loop**: the permanent control loop.
- **Tools**: coded functions the model may call. Keep them few and sharp.
- **Hooks (middleware)**: deterministic code on loop events. `before_model` injects context (working memory, RLS scope, the semantic-layer router). `wrap_tool_call` gates or vetoes actions (AST allowlist, cost/EXPLAIN, PII, RLS). This is where fail-closed lives.

> **Engine vs fuel**
>
> The kernel is the engine. The **corpus is the fuel** the hooks deliver into
> the loop. As models improve, you delete tools and shrink hooks. You don't
> rewrite the kernel.

## 4. Four Shared Services

Fork only the harness, but share the substrate. Sharing has three directions, and they tell you where the contracts live:

- **Curator writes → Analyst reads:** semantic layer, notes, metadata/indexes. Contract: publish/certify (versioned).
- **Analyst writes → curator reads:** audit log, corrections, episodic signals. Contract: harvest (closes the loop).
- **Both read one definition:** gateway policy, eval set and ground truth, identity/access model, tool registry, provenance format.

1. **Gateway service**: access, policy enforcement, and audit (one boundary, two permission profiles).
2. **Corpus service**: semantic layer, notes, metadata, and indexes (publish/read API, versioned).
3. **Memory service**: working, profile, episodic, and correction memory. Correction is the cross-agent channel.
4. **Eval / telemetry service**: ground truth and run history, the shared scoreboard.

## 5. Storage: Match Representation to Access Pattern (RVGD)

| Part of the corpus | Representation |
|---|---|
| Notes: routing rules, gotchas, procedural knowledge | YAML typed asset (`NoteAsset`, git); `body` is an optional on-demand long-form field (D17) |
| Metric / dimension / rule definitions | Compiled config (MetricFlow / MDL / OSI-style) |
| Schema, joins, FK connectivity, lineage | Graph (FK graph → Neo4j at scale) |
| "Which doc / table / example is relevant?" | Vector index + BM25 |
| Memory (working/profile/episodic/correction) | Postgres + pgvector |

Markdown-first. The graph earns its place only for joins and lineage. A heavy LLM knowledge graph is deferred. Rationale: curation and structure beat representation sophistication. Anthropic's null result showed raw-corpus grep moved accuracy <1pt. See the *Data Agent Memory Design Overview*.

*Built today:* retrieval runs the pure-Python **BM25** lexical channel plus deterministic grounding over the corpus relationships, and a **vector / semantic channel** (embeddings, fused with BM25 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion) behind an injected `Embedder` seam, off unless an embedder is passed. The FK graph is the in-memory `networkx` projection that drives Steiner join planning; Neo4j stays the enterprise-scale projection. Model choices (the OpenAI `gpt-5.6-luna` LLM and `text-embedding-3-small` embedder, both swappable) live in a project config file (`governed_bi.toml`, parsed by `config.load_settings`); the API key is read from the environment, never stored. The clients live in `governed_bi.llm` behind `ChatClient` / `Embedder` protocols, each with a deterministic offline default so the pipeline runs with no model or network. (The no-model *serve* mode is gone: per [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) P2, the agentic core requires a real key (serve fails closed at startup without one), and CI determinism comes from a `FakeListChatModel` agent harness rather than an offline serve default.)

> **Corpus contract = Git+YAML typed assets, curator-authored / human-audited (D9)**
>
> The "compiled config" row is realized as *《从数据到智能》*-style typed YAML
> assets (`table/column/join/few_shot/term/metric/rule`). The curator writes
> them; a human audits via the viz surface. **Git is the single source of
> truth. The graph (in-memory for BIRD, Neo4j as a derived projection for
> enterprise scale), vector, BM25 and Postgres are all rebuildable projections, never
> authored directly.** Column reliability is AI-inferred *prose* ("UNRELIABLE,
> DO NOT USE"), not a typed decoy flag, so the mechanism transfers to an enterprise deployment.
> See D9 in [Design decisions](design-decisions.md).

## 6. Runtime Query Flow (Analyst)

```
ask → supervisor → query understanding → intent route → SQL cache check →
RVGD retrieval → Steiner-tree join plan → SQL gen → five-layer guardrails →
execute (as-user) → narrate → answer + provenance
```

The full stage-by-stage design is in [Analyst](analyst.md), along with the three points where the curator's inference drives serve behavior.

Per D15, on the multi-schema Postgres / Redshift path a join-aware schema router precedes RVGD retrieval, so retrieval spans schemas; the single-schema path skips it. **Shipped** (`retrieval.schema_router`; wired in `analyst.agent`).

> **SQL semantic cache fast path**
>
> Embed the question → cosine similarity ≥0.92 against the cached-SQL library →
> hit skips retrieval, planning, and generation, but **always re-executes** the
> cached SQL (freshness over latency; cache SQL text only, never results,
> matching D7's identity scoping). Miss → full pipeline, then write back to the
> cache on success. TTL 15 min. Single global threshold, a known gap that is
> not tuned per domain. See the *Data Agent Memory Design Overview* §5.

Guardrails, in order (fail-closed on any, all five enforced): syntax → policy blacklist → AST column allowlist → term-semantics → cost. The AST allowlist is scope-aware (resolves each column against its own query scope and blocks star projections); term-semantics licenses the retrieved tables plus their FK join-neighborhood, the join plan's Steiner points (not just the exact retrieved set, so it is decoupled from retrieval recall), and any curated cross-schema join targets, and blocks any table name outside that licensed scope. The cost layer is a structural cross-join guard for now; numeric EXPLAIN-based cost (Postgres / Redshift) is future per-dialect work. Stage-by-stage detail is in [Analyst](analyst.md) step 8.

> **D15: L4 scope is schema-qualified and spans schemas.** Cross-schema names are licensed only via a curated join — with none, the engine refuses rather than guessing. The single-schema / SQLite / BIRD path stays bare/unqualified. Guardrail + serve wiring + missing-edge refusal + join-aware schema router are shipped.

> **Bounded self-repair (agent tool-reflection loop)**
>
> Generation, guardrails, and execution run as a bounded loop, but not a
> hand-rolled one: `run_query` is a governed, read-only tool the agent calls
> and re-calls. A guardrail rejection or an execution error comes back to the
> agent as a `ToolMessage` to reflect on and retry, rather than refusing
> outright; every attempt is re-guardrailed, so un-vetted SQL never runs. The
> per-turn attempt cap (3) is enforced in `wrap_tool_call`, and the outer graph
> is bounded by a `recursion_limit`; exhaustion fails closed. A repaired answer's
> `semantic_assurance` drops to `heuristic`, not `grounded` (in the retired,
> display-only single-axis tier: `lineage`, not `governed`).
>
> This is the [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) mechanism.
> The earlier hand-rolled `while attempts < 3` cycle (generation → guardrails →
> execution as a hard-coded loop) it replaced is deleted. The guardrail and
> stamp are unchanged (the same shared governance core runs at the tool
> boundary), so autonomy widens for *how to find the answer*, never for what
> may execute.

> **Governance ledger**
>
> Under [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md), enforcement
> and audit share one interception point: the `wrap_tool_call`
> middleware that guardrails a call also records it. Each turn accumulates an
> append-only ledger, one entry per governed action (refuse-gate result, tools
> offered, each exploration's surfaced / `excluded`-filtered assets, each
> `run_query`'s normalized SQL + per-layer L1-L5 verdict + licensed tables +
> result meta, and the stamp derivation). You cannot execute (or refuse) without
> a record. It lives on `Answer` provenance now; a durable sink is a seam for
> later.
>
> Since Amendment 2 the ledger also **streams live**: `agent_core` runs
> `agent.stream(...)` and re-emits each governed action through `on_event` as a
> typed step event (`rail` / `tool` / `final`), so the UI renders a per-attempt
> live audit of the loop. The `run_query` event detail is the ledger entry itself,
> so the live stream and the stored ledger cannot drift. Contract:
> [`docs/plans/agent-step-visualization.md`](plans/agent-step-visualization.md).
>
> Since Amendment 3, observability also collapses to **one inherited tracing
> handler per turn**: Langfuse is attached once at the outer `graph.invoke` and
> inherited by everything below it, including the `narrate` node's model call
> (narration is now its own graph step, not a side-call inside finalization) and
> the inner `agent.stream`. A turn is therefore one Langfuse trace with no
> doubled model-call cost/tokens.

> **Refusal & best-effort (two concurrent gates, not a waterfall)**
>
> - **Refuse-gate** (curated negative examples): match → canned escalation blob (owner contact). This is the fail-closed path.
> - **Hard guardrails** (`wrap_tool_call`): can veto any query regardless.
> - **Best-effort otherwise:** delivered with a **reliability stamp** —
>   `semantic_assurance` (`grounded` / `heuristic` / `unverified`) plus the
>   uncertainty flags that fired. The legacy single-axis tier (`governed` /
>   `lineage` / `fenced_raw` / `refused`) survives only as a display-only 1:1
>   projection of this axis, never a second vocabulary. The boundaries are
>   uncalibrated governance/uncertainty heuristics, tuned on the eval: `grounded`
>   means safe, in-scope, and no uncertainty flag, **not** verified-correct. The
>   guardrails are a safety/governance gate, not a correctness oracle, so a
>   plausible-but-wrong query (valid, in-allowlist, wrong computation) is caught
>   here and by the fail-closed paths, not at a guardrail. Give the stamp teeth:
>   low-reliability answers get differential handling.
> - **High-stakes** (leadership/PII): human sign-off or return-SQL-only.

## 7. Memory Policy

- Working memory: always on (session, identity-scoped).
- Episodic and correction: off by default. Adopted per-domain only when eval earns it, with value-aware retrieval when used.
- Durable memory is PR-gated exactly like the corpus → the memory/corpus distinction collapses. Correction memory ≈ correction-harvesting→PR-to-reference-doc. Promoted episodic ≈ gated few-shots. Only working/ephemeral memory is outside the gate.

> **Reusable numbers** (starting point; tune against BIRD-Obfuscation eval before adopting)
>
> | Parameter | Value |
> |---|---|
> | Working memory | session-scoped, cleared at session end |
> | Profile TTL | 365 days |
> | Episodic TTL | 90 days + 0.02/day decay |
> | Correction TTL | 180 days |
> | SQL cache TTL | 15 min |
> | Cache-hit gate | cosine ≥ 0.92 (see §6) |
> | Few-shot recall gate | cosine ≥ 0.95, confidence ≥ 0.9, fail_count ≤ 3 |
> | Route memory budget (Profile / Episodic / Correction) | nl2sql 5/2/5 · kpi_lookup 2/0/1 · knowledge_qa 3/1/1 · deep_analysis 8/8/4 |
> | Few-shot promotion gate | `pending_review` → human `approve` → retrieval-time threshold check |

## 8. Evaluation

- Near-term: [BIRD-Obfuscation](https://github.com/Minhao-Zhang/BIRD-Obfuscation) (4 DB versions, ~10k verified Q&A, decoy manifest, rename map) supplies verified ground truth. See *BIRD Bench Obfuscation Methodology*.
- Headline metric: execution accuracy vs gold. No hand-grading of semantic layers.
- **Split (adopt BIRD-Obfuscation's):** per-DB **80/20 seeded holdout**: 8,134 train / 2,030 test, all 69 DBs in both. The **curator reads `train_final.jsonl` only** (distilled, not dumped) → grade on held-out `test_final.jsonl`. Leakage is structurally prevented by the disjoint seeded split.
- **Variant:** the semantic eval runs on the **`rename_decoy`** instance (cryptic names and live decoys, where the layer's value is maximal), with `base` as a sanity reference. The Analyst always executes against the one physical DB. Only the corpus differs across arms.
- Arms scored on EX, an eval ladder (per [terminology-refactor.md](plans/terminology-refactor.md), refining the [D14 amendment](design-decisions.md#d14-sme-growth-benchmark-on-bird-obfuscation), 2026-07-15): `baseline` (deterministic, DB-derivable corpus only — names, types, sample values, FK candidates — no curator LLM), `curated` (curator LLM Inference tier + train-SQL-derived seed joins/few-shots), `curated_sme` (`curated` + Simulated-SME clarification rounds) — with a **test-aware SME oracle** as the dashed *`ceiling`*, designed but not yet built. The de-obfuscation "gold" oracle is **retired** (it was never a true ceiling — curator notes can exceed it). **Moat = the share of the obfuscation-induced accuracy drop the curator recovers.** Current run numbers (recorded under the old `A1/A2/A3` labels) are in [experiment results](plans/eval-ladder-results.md).
- Free behavioral signals from the manifest and logs: decoy-touch rate, governed-path adherence. Cost and efficiency (wall-clock, tokens, rows; BIRD's VES is reusable) are logged, not headline.
- **Refuse-gate eval:** a held-out **unanswerable** set, built from cross-DB and removed-coverage cases (auto-generated) plus a small hand-built out-of-scope set. The cross-DB cases are unanswerable here only because BIRD supplies no curated cross-schema joins; per D15 cross-schema *is* answerable with a curated join, though cross-schema serving is un-graded by BIRD. Scored on **refusal accuracy** (refuses the unanswerable) *and* **false-refusal rate** (on the answerable test set). This is the precision and recall of refusal.
- **Repo boundary:** BIRD-Obfuscation produces validated data and manifests, and explicitly scopes out "the downstream agent that exercises the traps". That downstream agent is *this* system.
- Later: retrieval-at-scale eval on an enterprise-scale deployment (Recall@K / MRR / nDCG, % answered via semantic layer).

> **Eval gaps**
>
> BIRD is small/clean → does **not** test retrieval-at-scale. BIRD questions are
> all answerable → does **not** test the refuse-gate (need a held-out
> unanswerable set). **Stretch arm:** withhold the train split for a few whole
> DBs to test *zero-seed* cold-start (~69 unfamiliar "companies"). This is
> deferred, not built first.

## 9. Environments (Toggles, not architecture forks)

| Concern | Dev / test (BIRD) | Prod (enterprise) |
|---|---|---|
| Human gate | auto-accept corpus changes | PR + owner + CI on every change |
| Identity / RLS | single all-access identity | real user, RLS at gateway |
| Serving | one process + files + SQLite | stateless server fleet; curator as async jobs; gateway/corpus/memory/eval as services; graph DB; caches |

Bake in the abstractions now (identity object, gate, scoped memory/cache) so prod is a config flip, not a rewrite.
