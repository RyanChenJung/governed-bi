# Agentic BI System

_[English](system-overview.md) · [简体中文](system-overview.zh.md)_

> **What this is**
>
> Design for an agentic BI / Generative-BI system: natural-language questions →
> grounded, governed, auditable answers over enterprise relational data.
> Near-term = a **SQLite-proven showcase** (personal GitHub; dialect-pluggable
> seams for other engines) that grows a reviewable semantic layer from a seed of
> known-good queries — *seed-assisted growth*, not a zero-prior cold start.
> Enterprise abstractions are seamed in but toggled
> off. Evaluated on the self-built [BIRD-Obfuscation](https://github.com/Minhao-Zhang/BIRD-Obfuscation) dataset (execution
> accuracy; cost logged). A private **enterprise fork** (phase 2) reuses this
> engine at enterprise scale, facing the same no-owner / no-manpower situation.

## Key points

- Two harnesses over one shared substrate: **curator** (builds the corpus) and **analyst** (answers). The semantic layer is the moat. Fail-closed.
- Design notes:
    - [Architecture](architecture.md): full design
    - [Design decisions](design-decisions.md): D1-D18 (+ 2026-07-15 audit dispositions) with alternatives and trade-offs
    - [Asset schemas](asset-schemas.md): the per-asset YAML field spec (Facts / Inference / Audit tiers)
    - [Curator](curator.md): the build-side proposer + adversary loop
    - [Analyst](analyst.md): the serve-side agent + guardrails (the [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md) governed agentic core is now the sole serve path; the earlier deterministic flow is retired)
    - [Viz](viz.md): the read-only audit surface — the presenter view models + the `governed_bi.api` HTTP API to browse the layer + chat with the analyst
    - [Glossary](glossary.md): canonical terms
- Grounded in the [external design sources](references.md).

## Status

> **Decided (D1-D18 + 2026-07-15 audit dispositions)**
>
> target · governed unit · eval · grading · refusal · ownership · identity ·
> memory · corpus contract · curator gate · external review · clarification
> protocol · corpus-as-own-repo · SME-growth benchmark · multi-schema serving
> (one DB, many schemas, executable cross-schema joins). See [Design decisions](design-decisions.md).

> **Built (code)**
>
> corpus (schemas / loader / validate / serialize) · graph projection + Steiner
> join planner (in-memory networkx) · gateway + five-layer guardrails · RVGD
> retrieval (BM25 + ground expansion, plus an embedder-gated vector channel fused
> with BM25 via RRF) · retrieval→context assembly · the [ADR 0002](adr/0002-governed-agentic-serve-runtime.md)
> governed agentic serve core (`analyst.agent`: deterministic rails +
> `create_agent` + governance middleware + read-only tools), the sole serve
> path since the P2 cutover · working memory · the eval scaffold · the
> read-only viz presenter view models + the `governed_bi.api` HTTP API · model
> config (`governed_bi.toml`) and the `ChatClient` / `Embedder` seams (raw OpenAI +
> LangChain + deterministic offline defaults) · the LLM curator proposer
> (descriptions + `suspect` caveats) · the **deepagents curator harness**
> (`curator.deep_agent`, construction). The corpus/curator/retrieval slice runs
> end-to-end with no model or network, and CI determinism for the agent path
> comes from a `FakeListChatModel` agent harness. (The earlier deterministic
> serve flow, `server.flow`, and the stale, unused `server.graph` DAG are
> deleted; serve now fails closed with no live model: `build_stack()` still
> builds offline for the read-only audit API, but the serve process raises at
> startup and `/chat` returns 503 until a model is configured.)

> **Pending (code)**
>
> LLM authoring of the remaining Inference assets (joins / terms / metrics / rules
> / notes) and the live per-asset adversary `refute` · the curator self-eval
> train-EX loop · the **full** obfuscated BIRD eval jsonl at scale (a small
> vendored beer_factory set stands in until it lands; the live eval-ladder harness
> already runs against a local Postgres with a live model) · the **D15** multi-schema build
> continues: wire rename + multi-schema serve + missing-edge refusal + server-side
> graph scoping + on-disk YAML `schema` field + join-aware schema router are
> **shipped**. Still deferred: server `/search` (client Fuse). The old
> `DataSourceConfig.db` (a schema pin) collapsed into `corpus_pin`; a new `db`
> field was since reintroduced (`config.py`) as the lake identity for `db:`
> note-scope sentinels (ADR 0003), distinct from `corpus_pin`.
> Without the eval data the arms cannot yet show the moat.

> **Open (design-level)**
>
> - Reliability-inference signals: the exact evidence the curator uses (deepens Curator Phase 2)
> - Refuse-gate + negative-example curation + held-out unanswerable set
> - Analyst tool registry (few, sharp): the exact tool list (flow in [Analyst](analyst.md))
> - Curator exploration tactics: probe-query strategies (loop in [Curator](curator.md))
>
> *Parked (development, per "design-first"):* build ordering / critical path.
> *Resolved → notes/decisions:* storage layout (D9) · gold auto-derivation (D4)
> · train/test split (§8) · corpus schemas ([Asset schemas](asset-schemas.md))
> · curator loop ([Curator](curator.md)) · analyst flow ([Analyst](analyst.md))
> · viz/audit ([Viz](viz.md)).
