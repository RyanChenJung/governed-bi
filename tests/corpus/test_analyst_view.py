    """The control that replaces ``restamp_model_authored``, which had zero callers.

    ADR 0005 §1.5 says ``governance.excluded`` and certified human provenance are human-only,
    and ``corpus/provenance.py`` existed to strip forgeries at the phase boundary where a
    model-authored corpus is accepted. It was never called — by anything, ever (audit §10) — so
    a reader of §1.5 came away believing a boundary check ran.

    There is no such boundary in this tree, and the reason is stronger than the check would
    have been: the only model-authored write path, ``tools/graft_corpus_fields.py``, **refuses
    the whole ``governance`` field** rather than sanitising it, and refuses ``reliability`` and
    ``summary`` too. A refusal cannot be forged past; a re-stamp can be forgotten.

    So this asserts the refusal instead, and it asserts it against the tool's own declared list
    so that adding ``governance`` to the graftable set fails here. When a curator is built, it
    is the thing that owes a re-stamp, and ADR 0005 §1.5 now says so.
