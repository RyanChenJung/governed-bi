    This is what makes ``gold_fingerprint`` a usable field: a fingerprint computed by
    BIRD-Obfuscation's ``pipeline/_db.py`` can be put in a question row and compared here
    without re-executing the gold statement. "Aligned with BIRD's own EX" was asserted in a
    docstring for the whole of v2 and was never checked against BIRD's own code; the
    predecessor sorted rows by ``json.dumps`` and wrapped them in ``{"rows": ...}``, so it
    produced a different digest for the same rows and nothing ever noticed.

    ``normalise_result`` is transcribed here rather than imported: the benchmark is a
    separate repository that is not a dependency of this one, and a test that skips when it
    is absent is a test that does not run.
