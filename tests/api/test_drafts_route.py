"""GET /corpus/drafts (fix round, task D): the approval queue reads fresh off disk.

Original bug: the queue's first data source, GET /corpus/assets, reads
`session.assets_by_id`, a run constant frozen at session-build time (ADR 0005) -- so within
one server process it never observes a draft written, or a draft approved, after the session
was built. This module's fixtures write directly through `corpus.drafts.submit_draft` /
`corpus.store.write` -- the same primitives Phase 3's live path uses, and the same idiom
`tests/api/test_corpus_conflicts_route.py` and `tests/api/test_draft_approve_route.py` already
use -- deterministic, no model call.
