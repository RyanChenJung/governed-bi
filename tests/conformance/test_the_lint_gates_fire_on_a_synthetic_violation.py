"""Every conformance gate under tools/ must fire on the violation it claims to catch.

Split out of test_register_closure.py by the 1000-line cap (ADR 0005 §6), which was forcing the
timing rather than the seam: that file's own docstring names its reason for existing as
cross-table closure across the register (kept there, in its first section), and everything here
is the file's other, self-contained concern -- a synthetic-tree harness (``_gate``,
``_synthetic_tree``, ``_probe_tree``, ``_layer_packages``, ``PROBE_NAME``) shared by every test
below, each of which plants one violation and asserts the tool under test returns 1 and names it.
A gate that only leaves a trace when it fires cannot afterwards be told from a gate that was
never wired up, which is why every test here is a negative one.

Covers: the declared-but-unconsumed ratchet, the layering gate, the citation gate, the
file-length hard/soft tiers, the one-implementation-per-concept gate (including its singleton
table), and the measurement-locality gate. Every test in this file drives the real tool as a
subprocess; none re-implements a check's own logic.

    one expired. So the gate takes ``--root`` and the test owns the tree.

    ``eval/projection.py``. Nine catalogue entries kept the old ``path`` while every anchor moved
    byte for byte into the new file, and a tenth drifted when ``stamp.py``'s guardrail tuple grew
    a field. The nightly ``mutate`` job reported all ten as **SURVIVED** — correctly, since a

    the stranded entry from one that fails whenever anything is missing — and naming it is the
