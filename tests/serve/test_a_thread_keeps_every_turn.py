"""``ServeState.turns``: a checkpoint holds the whole conversation's audit trail, not the newest turn.

**The defect this closes.** Every channel a turn's record is built from — ``answer``,
``execution``, ``generated_sql``, ``answer_text`` — is in ``PER_TURN_RESET``, so turn two erased
turn one and a thread's checkpoint could only ever describe its most recent question.
``runs/serve/*.jsonl`` was the only surviving copy, which made the audit surface depend on a
filesystem beside the process rather than on the store the conversation already lives in.

**Why the test drives the real served topology.** ``record`` is mounted on exactly one graph —
``build_graph(record=...)``, which only ``api/graph_app.build_serve_graph`` calls — and the reset
that this channel has to survive is written by ``accept``, the node in front of ``guard`` on that
same graph. Asserting the reducer over a hand-built two-node graph would prove that
``keep_turns`` appends, which ``tests/serve/test_the_turn_history_is_bounded.py`` does directly.
The pair that can actually break is ``accept``-resets-then-``record``-appends, so both nodes are
here, mounted the way production mounts them.

The one deviation from production is the checkpointer: ``build_serve_graph`` compiles without one
because the server supplies its own, and with no saver there is no second turn to have.
No model, no database — a scripted model and a connector double, as in
``test_the_abstention_policy_is_declared.py``.
