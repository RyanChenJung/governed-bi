"""``ServeState.turns`` under :func:`~governed_bi.serve.state.keep_turns`: bounded, deduplicated,
and honest about what it trimmed.

**The defect.** ``turns`` was ``Annotated[list[TurnEntry], operator.add]`` and each row holds a
full turn record. ``AsyncSqliteSaver`` has exactly two tables — ``checkpoints`` and ``writes`` —
and no per-channel blob store, so every super-step serialises the *whole* checkpoint into one
BLOB. Measured on the real store (``runs/conversations.sqlite``, 2026-08-18): 18 super-steps per
served turn and 103.8 KB per record, so turn *n* rewrote the previous *n-1* records eighteen
times. A two-turn thread had already written 5.89 MB. End to end on production-sized records the
marginal cost of turn 10 was **14.55 MB**, rising by ~1.6 MB with every turn and never stopping —
the TTL sweep is ``return (0, 0)`` under ``langgraph dev``, so nothing evicts locally.

**Why these tests are mostly at the reducer and not through the graph.** The end-to-end fixture's
two-schema corpus produces a 7.5 KB record, which is under
:data:`~governed_bi.serve.state.COMPACT_RECORD_BUDGET` — so a turn driven through the real
topology never trims anything, and a compaction test written that way would assert nothing while
looking thorough. The record shape that matters is the production one, so it is built here with
the measured key sizes. The cap and the append order *are* asserted through the served graph,
because those depend on ``accept``-resets-then-``record``-appends.
