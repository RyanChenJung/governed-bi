"""ADR 0006 B9 on the transport that is about to be the only one.

``POST /chat/resume`` is being retired, and it was the sole caller of
``serve/resume.resume_clarification`` — the only thing that ever compared the caller answering a
clarification against the caller who was asked. LangGraph Server resumes by posting a run with
``{"command": {"resume": …}}``, which the runtime applies to the pending interrupt *inside* the
graph; nothing in ``api/`` is consulted. So the route's deletion would have deleted a governance
control, silently, with every existing test still green.

**These tests drive the platform's shape rather than a route.** What LangGraph Server does to
resume is exactly ``graph.invoke(Command(resume=…), config)`` with the authenticated caller in
``config["configurable"]["langgraph_auth_user_id"]`` (``langgraph_api/models/run.py`` writes that
key from the auth context, after the client's own config is merged, and
``validation.py::RESERVED_CONFIGURABLE_KEYS`` refuses a request that names it). Reproducing that
here needs no server, no port and no model provider — and it is the same call the gate sees in
production, which is the property ``tests/api/test_a_run_cannot_write_state.py`` was rewritten to
have after a handler-level test passed against a dead handler for weeks.

The positive case is not decoration. Every negative assertion below is "the answer did not
arrive", and a gate that refused *everything* — or a graph that quietly stopped resuming at all —
would satisfy all of them. The paired authorised resume is what makes the negatives mean
something.
