"""F3: tools bounds, delivery_hash, ask_user HITL + identity-bound resume.

The outstanding-clarification latch's own tests (only one question paused at a time, and the
latch given back across a resume) moved to ``test_ask_user_outstanding_clarification_latch.py``
once this file passed the ADR 0005 §6 hard cap at 1,000 lines.

**Split again, 2026-08-18**, for the same reason: the ``sample_rows`` governed-executor cluster,
plus the two short generic checks nearest it (``test_delivery_hash_stable_for_same_tool_payload``,
``test_tool_bounds_from_state_includes_pulled_in``), moved to
``test_sample_rows_governed_executor.py``.
